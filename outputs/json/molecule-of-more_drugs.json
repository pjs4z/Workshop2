This biological signal propagates to the Meso-Cognitive plane, where it rewires the BDI architecture, creating a 'Wanting without Liking' loop that overrides the Frontal Lobes' rational braking system. The agent, now operating under a 'Hijacked Rationality,' executes behaviors that manifest in the Macro-Contextual plane as the destruction of social contracts, the liquidation of assets (Ian's home), and the necessity for external institutional interventions (Lawsuits, Taxes) to contain the biological runaway train."
