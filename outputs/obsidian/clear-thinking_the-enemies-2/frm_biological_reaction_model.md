# The Biological Reaction Model
**Definition:** A framework positing that human behavior is primarily driven by evolutionary hardwiring designed for survival, which often conflicts with the modern need for rational clarity. It distinguishes between automatic biological responses and conscious reasoning.
## Defined Concepts
* [[conc_biological_instinct|Biological Instinct]]: Hardwired behavioral programs written into DNA by natural selection (e.g., self-preservation, hierarchy organization) that execute automatically to save energy and ensure survival.
* [[conc_stimulus_response_gap|The Space]]: The critical interval between a stimulus and a response where an agent can choose to pause and apply reason rather than executing a default behavior.
* [[conc_reaction_vs_reasoning|Reaction vs. Reasoning]]: The binary distinction between the 'animal brain' (fast, automatic, emotional) and the 'conscious mind' (slow, deliberative, rational).
* [[conc_ordinary_moment|Ordinary Moment]]: Seemingly insignificant, everyday situations that trigger biological defaults and determine long-term success or failure, distinguished from obvious high-stakes crises.
* [[conc_unforced_error|Unforced Error]]: A mistake caused not by external difficulty, but by an internal failure to manage biological defaults, resulting in a self-inflicted setback.
