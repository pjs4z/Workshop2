# Environmental Reprogramming
**Definition:** A paradigm for behavior change that rejects willpower in favor of designing one's surroundings to make desired behaviors automatic.
## Defined Concepts
* [[conc_intentional_environment|Intentional Environment]]: A deliberately curated setting (physical or social) where the desired behavior becomes the path of least resistance, effectively overriding biological defaults.
* [[conc_willpower_fallacy|Willpower Fallacy]]: The conceptualization of willpower as a limited, exhaustible resource that inevitably fails against biological defaults over time.
* [[conc_social_pressure_utility|Social Pressure Utility]]: Using the 'Social Default' positively by aligning with groups where the norm is the desired behavior, leveraging conformity for self-improvement.
