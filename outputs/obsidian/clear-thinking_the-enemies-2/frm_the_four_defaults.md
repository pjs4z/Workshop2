# The Four Defaults Framework
**Definition:** The author's proprietary taxonomy of the four specific biological instincts that most frequently hijack clear thinking and cause unforced errors.
## Defined Concepts
* [[conc_emotion_default|The Emotion Default]]: The tendency to respond to situations based on immediate feelings (anger, fear, desire) rather than objective facts or reasoning.
* [[conc_ego_default|The Ego Default]]: The tendency to react defensively to anything that threatens self-worth, identity, or position in a social hierarchy, often prioritizing 'feeling right' over 'being right'.
* [[conc_social_default|The Social Default]]: The biological urge to conform to the norms and behaviors of a larger group to ensure belonging and avoid the risks of standing out.
* [[conc_inertia_default|The Inertia Default]]: The tendency to resist change, seek comfort, and maintain the status quo (habit-forming) to conserve energy, even when change is beneficial.
* [[conc_psychological_territory|Psychological Territory]]: An extension of physical territory that includes one's identity, beliefs, and status; when challenged, it triggers the same aggressive defense mechanisms as a physical threat.
* [[conc_hierarchy_instinct|Hierarchy Instinct]]: The wiring to organize the world into ranked orders to make sense of it, often leading to conflict when one's perceived status is challenged.
