**Satisfies Frame:** [[frm_the_four_defaults|The Four Defaults Framework]]
**Summary:** The author invested in a restaurant chain where the CEO slowly became a dictator. The author held the stock too long despite red flags because the changes were gradual.
## Concept Manifestations
* [[conc_inertia_default|The Inertia Default]]: The 'boiling frog' effect where the author resisted selling (changing state) because the negative changes were incremental.
* [[conc_ego_default|The Ego Default]]: The CEO's shift from partnership to dictatorship as success grew.
