## ⏱️ Execution Mereology
* **Pre-State:** A difficult problem requiring a novel solution; holding a visual image of the problem in mind before sleep.
* **Execution:** Sleeping to allow the uninhibited dopaminergic brain to make bizarre connections, then writing down the dream immediately upon waking.
* **Post-State:** Access to creative insights or solutions that were blocked by waking logic.
