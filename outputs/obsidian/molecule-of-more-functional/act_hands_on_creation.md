## ⏱️ Execution Mereology
* **Pre-State:** Living entirely in the abstract, digital, or future-focused world.
* **Execution:** Engaging in physical crafts (woodworking, knitting, gardening, repair) that require both planning and manual manipulation.
* **Post-State:** The creation of a tangible object ('birdhouse') that provides H&N satisfaction and grounds the creator in reality.
