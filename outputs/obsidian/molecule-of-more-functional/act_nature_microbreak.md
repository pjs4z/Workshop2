## ⏱️ Execution Mereology
* **Pre-State:** Mental fatigue and declining concentration from sustained effort.
* **Execution:** Taking a short (e.g., 40-second) break to view a natural scene (greenery, flowers) rather than concrete or screens.
* **Post-State:** Restored attention span and reduced error rates in subsequent tasks.
