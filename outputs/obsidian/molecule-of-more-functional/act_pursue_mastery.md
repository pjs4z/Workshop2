## ⏱️ Execution Mereology
* **Pre-State:** A desire to acquire a skill (e.g., music, coding, sports).
* **Execution:** Engaging in persistent, difficult practice that pushes beyond the comfort zone to extract maximum reward from the activity.
* **Post-State:** A state of 'flow' where dopamine (pursuit) and H&N (satisfaction) merge, creating an internal locus of control.
