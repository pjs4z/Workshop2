## ⏱️ Execution Mereology
* **Pre-State:** An environment filled with cues (people, places, things) that trigger the dopamine desire circuit.
* **Execution:** Physically removing all objects associated with the addiction (e.g., throwing away brewing equipment, deleting phone numbers) to eliminate visual/sensory cues.
* **Post-State:** A neutralized environment that reduces the frequency of involuntary craving spikes.
