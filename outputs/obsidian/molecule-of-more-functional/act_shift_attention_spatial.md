## ⏱️ Execution Mereology
* **Pre-State:** A state of imbalance where one is either stuck in unfulfilling consumption (down) or anxious dissatisfaction (up).
* **Execution:** Consciously shifting one's gaze and mental focus between the 'peripersonal' (immediate reach/sensation) and the 'extrapersonal' (distance/future possibility).
* **Post-State:** Activation of the specific brain circuit (H&N or Dopamine) required to either enjoy the present or plan for the future.
