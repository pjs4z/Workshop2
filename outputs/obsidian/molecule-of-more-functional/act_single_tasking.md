# Single-Tasking

> [!abstract] Teleology & Agency
> **ufo:motivated_by::** [[mom_multitasking_harm|The Multitasking Trap]] - *The belief that multitasking is harmful drives the deliberate practice of single-tasking.*

> [!warning] Systemic Friction & Reality
> **doc:constrained_by::** [[doc_corporate_schedules|Corporate Work Schedules / SLAs]] - *Institutional requirements for constant availability and multitasking create friction that makes single-tasking difficult.*

## ⏱️ Execution Mereology
* **Pre-State:** The urge to multitask (e.g., check email while on a call) driven by dopamine's desire for more stimuli.
* **Execution:** Deliberately restricting attention to one specific task at a time until completion.
* **Post-State:** Higher quality work, increased efficiency, and reduced stress/burnout.
