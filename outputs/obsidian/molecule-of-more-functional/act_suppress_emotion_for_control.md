# Cold Calculation (Emotion Suppression)

> [!abstract] Teleology & Agency
> **dul:classified_by::** [[conc_dopamine_control_circuit|Dopamine Control Circuit]] - *The control circuit is the theoretical mechanism that categorizes the behavior of suppressing emotion for strategy.*
> **ufo:requires::** [[conc_dopamine_control_circuit|Dopamine Control Circuit]] - *The action of cold calculation inherently relies on activating the dopamine control circuit.*

> [!warning] Systemic Friction & Reality
> **top:shifts::** [[traj_locus_of_control|Locus of Control]] - *The action shifts the agent from a passive emotional state to an active, internal locus of control.*

## ⏱️ Execution Mereology
* **Pre-State:** A high-stakes crisis or threat triggering H&N fear/panic responses.
* **Execution:** Consciously inhibiting the emotional reaction to allow the dopamine control circuit to analyze resources and strategize.
* **Post-State:** Rational, deliberate action taken to dominate the environment or ensure survival.
