# Transition to Companionate Love

> [!abstract] Teleology & Agency
> **dul:classified_by::** [[conc_here_and_now_molecules|Here & Now Molecules (H&Ns)]] - *The concept of H&N molecules categorizes the behaviors involved in shifting to companionate love.*
> **ufo:motivated_by::** [[mom_transition_love|Transition to Companionate Love]] - *The intention to shift focus from thrill to satisfaction drives the execution of companionate behaviors.*
> **ufo:brings_about::** [[goal_companionate_love|Companionate Love]] - *The action of shifting to H&N behaviors directly results in the goal of a stable, long-term bond.*

> [!warning] Systemic Friction & Reality
> **doc:constrained_by::** [[doc_top_doc_list|Washingtonian's Top Doc List]] - *External validation systems create pressure to pursue status (dopamine), making it harder to settle into companionate satisfaction.*
> **top:shifts::** [[traj_temporal_focus|Temporal Focus]] - *The action moves the agent's focus from the Future (Dopamine) to the Present (H&N).*

## ⏱️ Execution Mereology
* **Pre-State:** The inevitable fading of the 12-18 month 'passionate' dopamine high in a relationship.
* **Execution:** Deliberately shifting value from the thrill of the unknown to the sensory appreciation of the partner's presence, touch, and shared reality (H&N behaviors).
* **Post-State:** Establishment of a stable, long-term bond mediated by oxytocin and endorphins rather than dopamine.
