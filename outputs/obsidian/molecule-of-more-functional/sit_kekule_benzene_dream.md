# Kekulé's Ouroboros Dream

> [!book] Narrative Summary
> Chemist Friedrich August Kekulé struggles to figure out the structure of benzene. In a dream state (where H&N sensory constraints are lowered and dopamine flows freely), he sees a snake biting its own tail. This 'bizarre' association leads him to the scientific breakthrough of the benzene ring.
