# Pettigrew's Peripersonal vs. Extrapersonal Mapping

> [!book] Narrative Summary
> Neuroscientist John Douglas Pettigrew discovers that the brain maps the world into two distinct zones: the 'peripersonal' (within reach, controlled by H&N molecules) and the 'extrapersonal' (out of reach, controlled by dopamine). This explains why wanting (future) and liking (present) are neurologically distinct.
