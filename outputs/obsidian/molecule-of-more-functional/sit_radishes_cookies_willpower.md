# The Radishes and Cookies Experiment

> [!book] Narrative Summary
> Participants are tempted with cookies but forced to eat radishes. Later, they are given an impossible puzzle to solve. Those who expended willpower resisting the cookies give up on the puzzle significantly faster than those allowed to eat the cookies, demonstrating that dopaminergic willpower is a finite resource.
