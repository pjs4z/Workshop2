# The Sailor Suppressing Panic in a Storm

> [!book] Narrative Summary
> A sailor faces a life-threatening equipment failure in a storm. The H&N urge to panic (fight-or-flight) nearly overwhelms him. He consciously suppresses the emotion to engage his dopamine control circuit, allowing him to coldly calculate a plan to steer the boat to safety using the sails.
