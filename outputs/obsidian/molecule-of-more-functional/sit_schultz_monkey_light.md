# Wolfram Schultz's Monkey and the Light Bulb

> [!book] Narrative Summary
> A monkey is trained to associate a light with a food pellet. Initially, dopamine fires when the food arrives. Once the pattern is learned, dopamine fires when the light turns on (anticipation), not when the food is eaten. If the food doesn't arrive, dopamine levels crash below baseline. This proved dopamine is about anticipation and prediction error, not the reward itself.
