# The Fading Honeymoon of Shawn and Samantha

> [!book] Narrative Summary
> Shawn and Samantha meet at a bar, fueled by the novelty and anticipation of the 'extrapersonal' unknown. They fall in love, obsess over each other, and marry. Over time, the relationship transitions from the thrill of the unknown to the familiarity of the 'peripersonal'. The dopamine rush fades, leaving them to either transition to companionate H&N love or seek new thrills elsewhere.
