# Skinner's Pigeons and Variable Rewards

> [!book] Narrative Summary
> B.F. Skinner conditions pigeons to peck a lever for food. When the reward is predictable, they peck lazily. When the reward is random (variable ratio), the pigeons peck frantically and obsessively. This mechanism underpins gambling addiction and social media scrolling.
