# The Addict
**Target Action:** Compulsive Consumption

## The BDI Triad (Architecture of Action)
*   **Belief:** The substance is the supreme survival resource, outweighing food, family, and safety.
*   **Desire:** Immediate relief from the pain of craving ("More"); not necessarily pleasure ("Liking").
*   **Intention:** To procure and consume the substance regardless of long-term destruction or moral constraints.

## Social Moments
*   Manipulation of loved ones.
*   Formation of agentic relationships (e.g., with dealers).
*   Social isolation to facilitate consumption.
