# The Control Circuit Strategist
**Target Action:** Domination of Environment

## The BDI Triad (Architecture of Action)
*   **Belief:** The environment is a set of resources to be maximized through calculation and will.
*   **Desire:** Efficiency, victory, and future security.
*   **Intention:** To suppress immediate emotion (fear, empathy) to execute the most effective logical path (e.g., The Trolley Problem).

## Social Moments
*   Use of submissive behavior as a manipulation tactic.
*   Cold violence (instrumental aggression).
*   Cheating to maintain the "high" of winning.
