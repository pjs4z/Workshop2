# The Creative Genius
**Target Action:** Model Breaking / Abstract Creation

## The BDI Triad (Architecture of Action)
*   **Belief:** The current model of reality is insufficient; a deeper, abstract truth exists beyond the senses.
*   **Desire:** To dominate the environment through understanding, discovery, and the creation of the "New".
*   **Intention:** To sacrifice H&N pleasures (socializing, sleep, comfort) to pursue the work.

## Social Moments
*   Benevolent Misanthropy (loving humanity but disliking humans).
*   Social awkwardness or detachment due to suppressed H&N empathy.
*   Agentic use of others to further the work.
