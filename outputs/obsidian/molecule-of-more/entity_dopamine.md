# Dopamine
**Description:** Conceptualized not merely as a neurotransmitter, but as the "Narrator" of human behavior and the agent of "More." It is the chemical manifestation of the "Extrapersonal"—the realm of the future, possibility, and imagination.

## Qualia & Phenomenology
*   **Objective Quality:** Anticipatory chemical release triggered by [[entity_rpe|Reward Prediction Error]].
*   **Subjective Quale:** The thrill of possibility; the "itch" of the unknown; the feeling of "More" rather than "Enough."

## Contextual Framing
*   **Spatial-Temporal Ontology:** Represents the "Up" and "Future" in the Up vs. Down dichotomy.
*   **Incentive Salience:** Drives "Wanting" (Desire) often in opposition to "Liking" (Enjoyment).
