# H&Ns (Here and Now Molecules)
**Description:** The molecules of the present (Serotonin, Oxytocin, Endorphins, Endocannabinoids). They represent the "Peripersonal"—the realm of the present, sensory experience, satisfaction, and emotion.

## Qualia & Phenomenology
*   **Objective Quality:** Sensory processing and satiety signaling.
*   **Subjective Quale:** Contentment; bliss; the warm texture of reality; the feeling of being "in the moment."

## Contextual Framing
*   **Spatial-Temporal Ontology:** Represents the "Down" and "Now" (Peripersonal space).
*   **Moral Psychology:** The driver of "Hot Empathy" and deontological ethics, opposing the cold calculation of the [[entity_control_circuit|Control Circuit]].
