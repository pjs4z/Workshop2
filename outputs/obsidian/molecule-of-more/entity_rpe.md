**Description:** A cognitive event defined as the difference between expected and actual reward. It is the specific trigger for [[entity_dopamine|Dopamine]] release, implying that happiness is chemically tethered to the unexpected rather than the guaranteed.

**Role in Narrative:** It explains why the "honeymoon phase" of relationships and the "high" of drug use inevitably fade as novelty becomes familiarity.
