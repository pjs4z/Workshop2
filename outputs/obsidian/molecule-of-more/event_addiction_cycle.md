# The Addiction Cycle
## Mereology (Temporal Phases)
*   **Pre-State:** Encounter with a cue (person, place, thing) triggers "Salience"; the brain misidentifies the substance as a survival-critical resource.
*   **Execution:** Hijacking of the [[entity_desire_circuit|Desire Circuit]]; compulsive pursuit ("Wanting") decoupled from enjoyment ("Liking"); suppression of the [[entity_control_circuit|Control Circuit]].
*   **Post-State:** Downregulation of dopamine receptors (tolerance); intense craving (dopamine deficit); inability to experience pleasure from natural rewards (anhedonia).
