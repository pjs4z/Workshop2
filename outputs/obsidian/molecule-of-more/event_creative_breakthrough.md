# The Creative Breakthrough
## Mereology (Temporal Phases)
*   **Pre-State:** Low [[entity_latent_inhibition|Latent Inhibition]] allows influx of "irrelevant" sensory data; intense focus on a problem; dissatisfaction with existing models.
*   **Execution:** Dopaminergic activity unconstrained by H&N reality filters (often during dreams or semi-sleep); formation of novel, abstract connections.
*   **Post-State:** Re-engagement of the [[entity_control_circuit|Control Circuit]] to validate and manifest the abstract idea into reality (art, science, theory).

**Associated Agent:** [[agent_creative_genius|The Creative Genius]]
