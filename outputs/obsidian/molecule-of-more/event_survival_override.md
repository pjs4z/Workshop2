# The Survival Override
## Mereology (Temporal Phases)
*   **Pre-State:** Immediate physical threat (e.g., broken rudder in storm) triggers H&N panic (Norepinephrine/Fear).
*   **Execution:** Control Dopamine suppresses H&N emotion; cold, calculating logic takes over to manipulate resources and execute a survival plan.
*   **Post-State:** Removal of threat; Dopamine recedes; H&N emotion floods back, resulting in delayed physical reaction (shaking, weeping).
