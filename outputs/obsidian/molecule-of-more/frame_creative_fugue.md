## Frame Elements
*   **Agent:** [[agent_creative_genius|The Genius / The Madman]]
*   **Target:** The New Model (Abstract truth, artistic vision, scientific theory)
*   **Trigger:** Low [[entity_latent_inhibition|Latent Inhibition]] / Dream state / Dopaminergic surge
*   **Prior State:** Rigid adherence to conventional models of reality
*   **Outcome:** Insight, innovation, or delusion (depending on the ability to reintegrate with reality)

**Missing Variables:** Social conformity, Logical constraints, Sensory filtering.
