# The Creativity-Madness Spectrum
**Definition:** The model explaining how high dopamine levels and low sensory filtering lead to both genius and mental illness.
## Defined Concepts
* [[conc_salience|Salience]] - The tag the brain assigns to things it deems important or worthy of attention.
* [[conc_latent_inhibition|Latent Inhibition]] - The brain's ability to filter out irrelevant stimuli. Low latent inhibition (letting everything in) is the root of both creativity and psychosis.
* [[conc_model_breaking|Model Breaking]] - The dopaminergic act of dismantling conventional understandings of reality to form new connections (creativity).

**Satisfied By::** [[sit_william_schizophrenia|sit_william_schizophrenia]] - *William's delusions exemplify how low latent inhibition and aberrant salience can lead to madness.*
**Satisfied By::** [[sit_kekule_ouroboros_dream|sit_kekule_ouroboros_dream]] - *Kekule's dream illustrates how the reduced filtering (latent inhibition) during sleep facilitates model-breaking creativity.*
