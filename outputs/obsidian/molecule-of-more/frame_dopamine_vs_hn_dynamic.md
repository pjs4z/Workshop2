# The Dopamine vs. H&N Dynamic
**Definition:** The overarching struggle between the neurochemistry of anticipation/future-orientation (Dopamine) and the neurochemistry of experience/present-orientation (Here & Now molecules).
## Defined Concepts
* [[conc_dopamine|Dopamine (The Molecule of More)]] - The chemical of anticipation and possibility, not pleasure. It drives the pursuit of resources, creating a craving for the unexpected and the future.
* [[conc_hn_molecules|Here & Now Molecules (H&Ns)]] - A class of neurotransmitters (Serotonin, Oxytocin, Endorphins, Endocannabinoids) responsible for sensory experience, satisfaction, and enjoyment in the present moment.
* [[conc_opposing_circuits|Opposing Circuits]] - The physiological rule where activating dopamine circuits suppresses H&N circuits (and vice versa), making it difficult to simultaneously pursue and enjoy.
