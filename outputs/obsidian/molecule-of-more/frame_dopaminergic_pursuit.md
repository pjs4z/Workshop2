# The Dopaminergic Pursuit
**Authorial Perspective:** The authors frame human motivation as a biological narrative driven by a molecule that values the "unreal" future over the "real" present.

## Frame Elements
*   **Agent:** [[agent_dopaminergic_lover|The Dopaminergic Subject]] (Lover, Addict, Entrepreneur)
*   **Target:** The "Phantom" (The ideal partner, the drug high, the unearned million)
*   **Trigger:** [[entity_rpe|Reward Prediction Error]] (Unexpected novelty or possibility)
*   **Prior State:** Boredom or dissatisfaction with the "Here and Now"
*   **Outcome:** Temporary exhilaration followed by habituation ([[vibe_letdown_of_reality|The Letdown]]) and a renewed craving for "More"

**Missing Variables:** Permanent Satisfaction, Satiety, Appreciation of the present.
