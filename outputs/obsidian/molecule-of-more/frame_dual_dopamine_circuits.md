# The Dual Dopamine Circuits
**Definition:** The bifurcation of dopamine function into two distinct pathways: one for raw impulse (Desire) and one for calculated planning (Control).
## Defined Concepts
* [[conc_desire_circuit|Dopamine Desire Circuit]] - The mesolimbic pathway responsible for raw wanting, craving, enthusiasm, and impulse. It acts like 'the kid in the back seat'.
* [[conc_control_circuit|Dopamine Control Circuit]] - The mesocortical pathway responsible for calculation, planning, tenacity, and domination. It acts like 'the parent at the wheel', managing raw desire to achieve long-term goals.
* [[conc_dopamine_opposing_dopamine|Dopamine Opposing Dopamine]] - The internal conflict where the Control Circuit suppresses the Desire Circuit (willpower) to maximize future gain over immediate gratification.

**Satisfied By::** [[sit_resolute_rats|sit_resolute_rats]] - *The rat experiment demonstrates the function of the Control Circuit in generating tenacity and effort independent of pleasure.*
