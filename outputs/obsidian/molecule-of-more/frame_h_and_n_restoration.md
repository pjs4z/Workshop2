# The H&N Restoration
**Authorial Perspective:** Happiness is framed as a distinct neurochemical state (H&N) that requires the suppression of dopamine to experience reality.

## Frame Elements
*   **Agent:** The Companionate Partner / The Craftsman
*   **Target:** The Peripersonal Object (The child, the meal, the finished work)
*   **Trigger:** Sensory immersion, physical touch, or completion of a task
*   **Prior State:** Dopaminergic striving or anxiety
*   **Outcome:** Contentment, social bonding, and "Sensory Satiety"

**Missing Variables:** Ambition, Future planning, The drive for "More".
