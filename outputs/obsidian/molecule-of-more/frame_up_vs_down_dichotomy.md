# The Up vs. Down Dichotomy
**Definition:** A spatial and neurochemical framework that divides human experience into two distinct realms: the peripersonal (what is within reach/possession) and the extrapersonal (what is out of reach/future possibilities), governed by different chemical systems.
## Defined Concepts
* [[conc_peripersonal_space|Peripersonal Space]] - The 'Down' world; the realm of immediate reach and possession (looking down) where interaction happens in the here and now, controlled by H&N chemicals.
* [[conc_extrapersonal_space|Extrapersonal Space]] - The 'Up' world; the realm of distant possibility (looking up) requiring planning and effort to reach, governed exclusively by dopamine.
* [[conc_mental_time_travel|Mental Time Travel]] - The ability to project oneself into various possible futures using imagination to maximize resource acquisition.

**Satisfied By::** [[sit_pettigrew_flying_primates|sit_pettigrew_flying_primates]] - *The research on bat evolution provides the empirical basis for the theoretical distinction between peripersonal and extrapersonal space.*
