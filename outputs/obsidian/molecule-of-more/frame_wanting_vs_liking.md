# The Wanting vs. Liking Paradox
**Definition:** The distinction between the drive to acquire (Dopamine) and the capacity to enjoy (H&Ns), explaining why achieving goals often leads to dissatisfaction.
## Defined Concepts
* [[conc_reward_prediction_error|Reward Prediction Error]] - The specific trigger for dopamine release, occurring only when an outcome is better than expected (surprise). It ceases once rewards become predictable.
* [[conc_buyers_remorse|Buyer's Remorse]] - The collapse of dopamine activity upon possession, where the 'phantom' promise of the future dissolves into the mundane reality of the present.
* [[conc_dopamine_phantom|Dopamine Phantom]] - An imagined future reward or alternate reality conjured by dopamine to drive behavior, regardless of its feasibility or truth.

**Satisfied By::** [[sit_schultz_monkey_experiment|sit_schultz_monkey_experiment]] - *Schultz's experiment provides the biological proof that dopamine signals anticipation (wanting) rather than the receipt of reward (liking).*
