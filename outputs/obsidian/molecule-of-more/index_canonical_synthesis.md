# The Neurochemical Bifurcation of Reality
**Summary:** A comprehensive socio-cognitive model positing that human existence is defined by the tension between two opposing neural systems: the Dopaminergic system (governing the Extrapersonal, the Future, and Desire) and the H&N system (governing the Peripersonal, the Present, and Satisfaction). This tension drives migration, madness, love, and progress, but threatens individual happiness and species survival if left unbalanced.

## The Tripartite Convergence Matrix

> [!NOTE] The Micro-Intrinsic Plane (Substrate)
> **Somatic & Systemic Drivers:**
> *   **Circuits:** [[entity_desire_circuit|The Desire Circuit]] (Raw Wanting) vs. [[entity_control_circuit|The Control Circuit]] (Calculation/Planning).
> *   **Chemistry:** [[entity_h_and_ns|H&N Neurotransmitters]] (Serotonin, Oxytocin) vs. [[entity_dopamine|Dopamine]].
> *   **Genetics:** [[entity_7r_allele|The 7R Allele]] (The Adventure Gene).
> *   **Filters:** [[entity_latent_inhibition|Latent Inhibition]] (Gating of Sensory Data).
> *   **Conceptual Coordinates:** High abstraction, future focus (-1.0 Temporal Focus), and low hedonic valence.

> [!NOTE] The Meso-Cognitive Plane (Internal/Agentive)
> **Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI):**
> *   **Belief:** The "Phantom" of the ideal future is superior to the reality of the present.
> *   **Desire:** Insatiable acquisition ("More") decoupled from enjoyment ("Liking").
> *   **Intention:** To dominate the environment, dismantle existing models, or maximize resources at the expense of the "Here and Now".
>
> **Emotion Situations:**
> *   [[vibe_thrill_of_possibility|The Thrill of Possibility]] (Dopaminergic Arousal).
> *   [[vibe_glow_of_mastery|The Glow of Mastery]] (Balanced Flow).
> *   [[vibe_agony_of_craving|The Agony of Craving]] (Hijacked Deficit).

> [!NOTE] The Macro-Contextual Plane (External/Normative)
> **Normative Descriptions:**
> *   **The Dopaminergic Society:** Endless growth and consumption framed as virtue.
> *   **Political Ideology:** Liberal (Change/Dopamine) vs. Conservative (Stability/H&N).
> *   **The Immigrant Narrative:** Risk-taking and migration as cultural DNA.
>
> **Inscribed Acts & Constraints:**
> *   [[act_psychiatric_diagnosis|Psychiatric Diagnosis]] (Schizophrenia/Bipolar as "Too Much Dopamine").
> *   [[act_patents_and_nobel_prizes|Patents and Nobel Prizes]] (Institutionalized Genius).
> *   [[act_marriage_contracts|Marriage Contracts]] (Binding passion to stability).
