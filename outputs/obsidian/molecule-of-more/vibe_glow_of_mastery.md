# The Glow of Mastery
## Emotion Frame Elements
*   **Experiencer:** The Craftsman / The Builder
*   **Trigger:** The tangible completion of a physical task (e.g., building a birdhouse).
*   **Appraisal:** I have exerted control over the physical world and the result is good.
*   **Physiological Substrate:** Harmonious blend of [[entity_dopamine|Dopamine]] (success) and [[entity_h_and_ns|H&N]] (sensory appreciation).
*   **Social Display Rule:** Quiet pride, relaxation, "kicking back", sharing the result with others.
