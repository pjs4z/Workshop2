# The Hijacked Desire Circuit
**Definition:** The structural model explaining how supernormal stimuli (drugs, porn, gambling) bypass natural satiety mechanisms to create pathological behavior.
## Defined Concepts
* [[conc_desire_circuit|The Desire Circuit]]: The mesolimbic pathway (VTA to Nucleus Accumbens) evolved to promote survival behaviors (food, sex) by generating urge and motivation.
* [[conc_the_hijack|The Hijack]]: The process by which artificial agents (drugs/technology) stimulate the desire circuit far more intensely than natural rewards, repurposing survival instincts into enslavement to the agent.
* [[conc_dopamine_control_circuit|Dopamine Control Circuit]]: The opposing force to the Desire Circuit, located in the frontal lobes. It is rational, cold, and calculating, using long-term planning to maximize future resources.
* [[conc_impulsive_behavior|Impulsive Behavior]]: A state where the Desire Circuit overpowers the Control Circuit, placing excessive value on immediate pleasure over long-term consequences.
