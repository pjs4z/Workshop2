# The Reward Prediction Mechanism
**Definition:** The system by which the brain learns from the environment, driven by the difference between expectation and reality.
## Defined Concepts
* [[conc_reward_prediction_error|Reward Prediction Error]]: A surge of dopamine triggered only when a reward is unexpected. It signals the brain to 'pay attention' and learn, fading once the reward becomes predictable.
* [[conc_dopamine_shutdown|Dopamine Shutdown]]: A drop in dopamine firing rates to zero when an expected reward fails to materialize, resulting in subjective feelings of resentment and deprivation.
* [[conc_dopaminergic_habituation|Habituation]]: The process by which dopamine suppresses its own activity as novel events become predictable, eliminating the 'rush' of the experience.
