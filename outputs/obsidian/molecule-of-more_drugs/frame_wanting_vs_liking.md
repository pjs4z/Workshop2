# The Dopamine vs. H&N Paradigm
**Definition:** A theoretical framework distinguishing between two distinct neurochemical systems: one driving the pursuit of future rewards (Wanting) and one enabling the enjoyment of the present moment (Liking).
## Defined Concepts
* [[conc_dopamine_desire|Dopamine (The Desire)]]: The molecule of 'wanting' and future-orientation. It generates motivation, excitement, and craving to acquire resources for survival, but is incapable of generating satisfaction or enjoyment.
* [[conc_hn_molecules|H&Ns (Here and Nows)]]: A collective term for neurotransmitters (endorphins, endocannabinoids, etc.) responsible for 'liking.' They process real-world sensory experience, satisfaction, and enjoyment in the present moment.
* [[conc_phantom_future|The Phantom Future]]: The abstract conceptual space where dopamine operates. It consists of idealized possibilities and 'what could be,' rather than reality.
* [[conc_concrete_present|The Concrete Present]]: The reality-based conceptual space where H&Ns operate. It consists of actual sensory experiences (taste, touch, emotion) happening in real-time.
* [[conc_buyers_remorse|Buyer's Remorse]]: A phenomenon occurring when the transition from Dopaminergic expectation (future) to H&N experience (present) fails; the reality of possession is less intense than the excitement of pursuit.
