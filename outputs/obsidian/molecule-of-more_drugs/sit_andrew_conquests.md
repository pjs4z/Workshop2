# Andrew's Conquests
**Satisfies Frame:** [[frame_wanting_vs_liking|The Dopamine vs. H&N Paradigm]]
**Summary:** Andrew, a salesperson and sex addict, spent his life chasing women. The pursuit was thrilling, but the moment he succeeded (often before even reaching the bedroom), his interest vanished, and the women appeared physically different to him—dull and uninteresting.
## Concept Manifestations
* [[conc_dopamine_desire|Dopamine (The Desire)]]: The thrill of the chase and the intense motivation to acquire a new partner.
* [[conc_dopamine_shutdown|Dopamine Shutdown]]: The sudden loss of interest and the 'dull gray' feeling the moment the conquest was assured.
* [[conc_the_hijack|The Hijack]]: The compulsion to repeat the pattern despite knowing it would not lead to happiness.
