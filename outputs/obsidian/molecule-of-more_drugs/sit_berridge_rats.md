# Berridge's Rats
**Satisfies Frame:** [[frame_wanting_vs_liking|The Dopamine vs. H&N Paradigm]]
**Summary:** Dr. Kent Berridge injected rats with dopamine boosters vs. H&N boosters. Dopamine-boosted rats drank more sugar water (wanting) but didn't lick their lips. H&N-boosted rats licked their lips furiously (liking/enjoying) but didn't necessarily drink more.
## Concept Manifestations
* [[conc_dopamine_desire|Dopamine (The Desire)]]: The behavior of consuming more sugar water without signs of enjoyment.
* [[conc_hn_molecules|H&Ns (Here and Nows)]]: The lip-smacking facial expression indicating sensory pleasure.
