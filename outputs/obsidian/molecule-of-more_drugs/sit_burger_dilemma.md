# The Burger Dilemma
**Satisfies Frame:** [[frame_wanting_vs_liking|The Dopamine vs. H&N Paradigm]]
**Summary:** A man on a diet smells burgers, imagines the taste, and succumbs to the urge to buy one. However, the enjoyment decreases with every bite, leaving him feeling nauseated and defeated rather than satisfied.
## Concept Manifestations
* [[conc_dopamine_desire|Dopamine (The Desire)]]: The overwhelming urge triggered by the smell and the imagination of the burger, overriding the diet.
* [[conc_phantom_future|The Phantom Future]]: The idealized 'hamburger heaven' the man imagined before taking a bite.
* [[conc_concrete_present|The Concrete Present]]: The actual sensory experience of eating, where enjoyment faded with each bite.
* [[conc_buyers_remorse|Buyer's Remorse]]: The feeling of defeat and nausea that followed the purchase, as the reality failed to match the expectation.
