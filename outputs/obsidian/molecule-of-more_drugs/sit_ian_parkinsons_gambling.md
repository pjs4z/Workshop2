# Ian's Parkinson's Gambling
**Satisfies Frame:** [[frame_addiction_circuitry|The Hijacked Desire Circuit]]
**Summary:** Ian, a retiree with Parkinson's, was prescribed a dopamine agonist (Cabaser). He suddenly developed a gambling addiction, selling his car and home to feed slot machines, despite previously being frugal. The behavior stopped immediately when he quit the drug.
## Concept Manifestations
* [[conc_desire_circuit|The Desire Circuit]]: The neural pathway artificially hyper-stimulated by the medication.
* [[conc_impulsive_behavior|Impulsive Behavior]]: The inability to weigh long-term consequences (losing his home) against the immediate urge to gamble.
* [[conc_dopamine_control_circuit|Dopamine Control Circuit]]: The rational part of the brain that was completely overpowered by the chemically enhanced desire.
