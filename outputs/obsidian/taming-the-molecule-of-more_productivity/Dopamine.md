# [[Dopamine]]
**Type:** #BFO/IndependentContinuant

## Concept Summary
[[Dopamine]] is a physical neurotransmitter, conceptualized in this system not just as a chemical but as a narrative agent driving the pursuit of novelty, acquisition, and future reward. It is the "Molecule of More" that devalues the present ("Here and Now") in favor of a promised, better future. It is the physical mediator of the [[Dopaminergic Cycle]].

While a physical object, its *effect* is to generate the Dependent Continuant of `The Itch` or desire within the [[Modern Human]].
