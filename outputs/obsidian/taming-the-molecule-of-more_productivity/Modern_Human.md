# [[Modern Human]]
**Type:** #BFO/IndependentContinuant

## Concept Summary
The [[Modern Human]] is the central agent in this system, modeled as a biological entity whose ancestral survival mechanisms are often in conflict with the modern environment. This agent is the bearer of cognitive states like [[Cognitive Fixation]] and [[Tragic Optimism]], and is the primary participant in all cognitive and behavioral processes.

The core struggle of the [[Modern Human]] is to move from a state of being a "twitchy, dissatisfied subject" governed by biological autopilot to a state of "inscribed agency" by consciously modulating their internal systems.
