# [[Taming the Biological Imperative]]
**Type:** #BFO/Occurrent

## Concept Summary
This is a continuous, life-long macro-process undertaken by the [[Modern Human]]. It represents the intentional effort to regulate the [[Dopaminergic Cycle]] and other primal drives through disciplined practices and the use of external tools like the [[Eisenhower Matrix]].

Its goal is to transform the agent's fundamental mode of being from one of biological reactivity to one of conscious, "tragic optimism." This process consumes the default state of the agent and, over time, yields a more balanced disposition.
