## Part 1: The Enemies of Clear Thinking

PART 1

THE ENEMIES OF CLEAR

THINKING

Never forget that your unconscious is smarter than you, faster than you, and more powerful than you. It may even control you. You will never know all of its secrets.

—CORDELIA FINE, A Mind of Its Own: How Your Brain

Distorts and Deceives

THE FIRST THING I heard was shouting. Generally, this is not what you expect to hear when approaching the CEO’s office. This CEO was different.

I walked into his office, put my briefcase on the table, and sat down directly across from him. He didn’t acknowledge my presence. While months of working for him had led me to expect as much, it was still unsettling.

I was his designated right hand, and almost nothing and no one got to him without going through me first. That’s what made this call so interesting. It wasn’t on his calendar.

Whomever he was talking with, the conversation had turned him red with rage. I had already learned the hard way not to interrupt him during moments like this with a nudge to take a breath. If I did, his wrath would quickly direct itself at me.

As he hung up, his eyes met mine. I knew I had a split second to say something, or he’d start yelling at me for having to take this unscheduled call.

“What was that all about?” I asked. “They needed to be put in their place,” he said. I didn’t know who had been on the other end of the phone, but the pitch of his anger led me to believe it was someone unfamiliar with him. The people who worked for this CEO knew it was easier not to tell him anything that might upset him. This included bad news, ideas that clashed with his beliefs, and of course a nudge to stop when he was making a situation worse.

It would be one of the last calls he ever took in his office. This ordinary moment changed everything.

It turned out, the person on the other end of that phone call was desperately trying to report a problem with serious consequences for the organization. When their concern was met with wrath that day, they decided to take their concerns to the board. Not long afterward, the CEO was fired.

While part of me wants to tell you it was directly because of his behavior, we both know that wouldn’t be true. He was fired for not acting on the very information the person on the other end of the phone was trying to tell him, because his ego wouldn’t allow for it. If he had been thinking clearly, he might still have his job.[*]*

### Chapter 1.1: Thinking Badly—Or Not Thinking at All?

CHAPTER 1.1

Thinking Badly—or Not Thinking at

All?

rationality is wasted if you don’t know when to use it.

When you ask people about improving thinking, they typically point toward numerous tools designed to help people think more rationally. Bookstores are full of books that assume the problem is our ability to reason. They list the steps we should take and the tools we should use to exercise better judgment. If you know you should be thinking, these can be helpful.

What I’ve learned from watching real people in action is that, just like the angry CEO, they’re often unaware circumstances are thinking for them. It’s as if we expect the inner voice in our head to say, “STOP! THIS IS A MOMENT WHEN YOU NEED TO THINK!”

And because we don’t know we should be thinking, we cede control to our impulses.

In the space between stimulus and response, one of two things can happen. You can consciously pause and apply reason to the situation. Or you can cede control and execute a default behavior.

The problem is, our default behavior often makes things worse. When someone slights us, we lash out with angry words. When someone cuts us off, we assume malice on their part. When things go slower than we want, we become frustrated and impatient.

When someone is passive-aggressive, we take the bait and escalate. In these moments of reaction, we don’t realize that our brains have been hijacked by our biology, and that the outcome will go against what we seek. We don’t realize that hoarding information to gain an advantage is hurting the team. We don’t realize we’re conforming to the group’s ideas when we should be thinking for ourselves. We don’t realize our emotions are making us react in ways that create problems downstream.

So our first step in improving our outcomes is to train ourselves to identify the moments when judgment is called for in the first place, and pause to create space to think clearly. This training takes a lot of time and effort, because it involves counterbalancing our hardwired biological defaults evolved over many centuries. But mastery over the ordinary moments that make the future easier or harder is not only possible, it’s the critical ingredient to success and achieving your long-term goals.

The High Cost of Losing Control

Reacting without reasoning makes every situation worse.

Consider a common scenario that I’ve seen countless times. A coworker slights a project you’re leading in a meeting. Instinctively you hit back with a comment that undermines them or their work. You didn’t make a conscious choice to respond, you just did. Before you even know what’s happening, the damage is done. Not only does the relationship suffer but the meeting goes sideways.

Too much energy is then consumed getting you back to where you were. The relationship needs to be repaired. The derailed meeting needs to be rescheduled. You might need to talk to the other people in the meeting to clear the air. And even after all of this, you might still be worse off than you were before. Every witness and every person they talked to about what happened received an unconscious signal that eroded their trust in you. Rebuilding that trust takes months of consistent behavior.

All the time and energy you spend fixing your unforced errors comes at the expense of moving toward the outcomes you want. There is a huge

advantage in having more of your energy instead go toward achieving your goals instead of fixing your problems. The person who learns how to think clearly ultimately applies more of their overall effort toward the outcomes they want than the person who doesn’t.

You have little hope of thinking clearly, though, if you can’t manage your defaults.

Biological Instincts

There’s nothing stronger than biological instincts. They control us often without us even knowing. Failing to come to terms with them only makes you more susceptible to their influence.

If you’re having trouble understanding why you sometimes react to situations in the worst possible way, the problem isn’t your mind. Your mind is doing exactly what biology programmed it to do: act quickly and efficiently in response to threats, without wasting valuable time thinking.

If someone breaks into your house, you instinctively stand between them and your kids. If someone approaches you with a menacing expression, you tense up. If you sense your job is at risk, you might unconsciously start hoarding information. Your animal brain believes you can’t be fired if you’re the only one who knows how to do your job. Biology, not your rational mind, told you what to do.

When our unthinking reactions make situations worse, that little voice in our head starts to beat us up: “What were you thinking, you idiot?” The truth of the matter is, you weren’t thinking. You were reacting, exactly like the animal you are. Your mind wasn’t in charge. Your biology was.

Our biological tendencies are hardwired within us.[*] Those tendencies often served our prehistoric ancestors well, but they tend to get in our way today. These timeless behaviors have been described and discussed by philosophers and scientists from Aristotle and the Stoics to Daniel Kahneman and Jonathan Haidt.[1]

For instance, like all animals, we are naturally prone to defend our territory.[2] We might not be defending a piece of terrain on the African

savanna, but territory isn’t just physical, it’s also psychological. Our identity is part of our territory too. When someone criticizes our work, status, or how we see ourselves, we instinctively shut down or defend ourselves. When someone challenges our beliefs, we stop listening and go on the attack. No thoughts, just pure animal instinct.

We’re naturally wired to organize the world into a hierarchy. We do this to help make sense of the world, maintain our beliefs, and generally feel better. But when someone infringes on our place in the world and our understanding of how it works, we react without thinking. When someone cuts you off on the highway and road rage kicks in, that’s your unconscious mind saying, “Who are you to cut me off?” You’re reacting to a threat to your inherent sense of hierarchy. On the road we are all equals. We’re all supposed to play by the same rules. Cutting someone off violates those rules and implies higher status.[*] Or consider when you get frustrated with your kids and end an argument with “Because I said so.” (Or the office equivalent: “Because I’m the boss.”) In these moments you’ve stopped thinking and regressed to your biological tendencies of reaffirming the hierarchy.

We’re self-preserving. Most of us would never intentionally push someone else down to get where we want to go.[*] The key word here is “intentionally,” because intention involves thought. When we’re triggered and not thinking, our desire to protect ourselves first takes over. When layoffs loom at a company, otherwise decent people will quickly throw each other under the bus to keep a job. Sure, they wouldn’t consciously want to hurt their colleagues, but if it comes down to “them versus me,” they will ensure they come out on top. That’s biology.

Our biological instincts provide an automatic response without conscious processing. After all, that’s what they’re for!

Conscious processing takes both time and energy. Evolution favored stimulus-response shortcuts because they’re advantageous for the group: they enhance group fitness, group survival, and reproduction. As humans continued flourishing in groups, hierarchies developed, creating order out of chaos and giving us all a place. Territory is how we tried to avoid fighting

others—you stay out of my territory, I’ll stay out of yours. And self- preservation means we choose survival over rules, norms, or customs.

The problem occurs when you zoom in from the aggregate to the individual, from the eons of evolution to the present moment of decision. In today’s world, basic survival is no longer in question. The very tendencies that once served us now often act as an anchor holding us in place, weakening our position, and making things harder than they need to be.

Knowing Your Defaults

While there are many such instincts, four stand out to me as the most prominent, the most distinctive, and the most dangerous. These behaviors represent something akin to our brain’s default or factory settings.[3] They’re behavioral programs written into our DNA by natural selection that our brains will automatically execute when triggered unless we stop and take the time to think. They have many names, but for the purposes of this book, let’s call them the emotion default, the ego default, the social default, and the inertia default.

Here’s how each essentially functions:

1. The emotion default: we tend to respond to feelings rather than reasons

and facts. 2. The ego default: we tend to react to anything that threatens our sense

of self-worth or our position in a group hierarchy. 3. The social default: we tend to conform to the norms of our larger

social group. 4. The inertia default: we’re habit forming and comfort seeking. We tend

to resist change, and to prefer ideas, processes, and environments that are familiar.

There are no hard edges between defaults; they often bleed into one another. Each on their own is enough to cause unforced errors, but when they act together, things quickly go from bad to worse.

People who master their defaults get the best real-world results. It’s not that they don’t have a temper or an ego, they just know how to control both rather than be controlled by them. With the ability to think clearly in ordinary moments today, they consistently put themselves in a good position for tomorrow.

In the following section I’ll give an overview of how these defaults manifest in human behavior, and how to recognize when they’re at play in your own life. Not only will your own past actions make more sense after taking defaults into account, but you’ll also learn to identify when others are reacting to them too.

### Chapter 1.2: The Emotion Default

CHAPTER 1.2

The Emotion Default

the godfather is one of my favorite movies, in part because of the many business lessons it contains. Vito Corleone, head of the Corleone crime family, is a master of patience and discipline. With his defaults under control, he never reacts without reasoning, and when he does react, it’s ruthlessly effective.

Vito’s oldest son, Santino, a.k.a. Sonny, is Vito’s heir apparent. Unlike his father, however, Sonny is vengeful, impulsive, and hotheaded. He easily flies into fits of rage, reacting first and reasoning later. His unforced errors ensure he’s constantly playing life on hard mode.

The emotion default controls Sonny, and he doesn’t realize it. On one occasion, he beats his brother-in-law, Carlo Rizzi, in public, an act that will have unintended future consequences. On another occasion, a rival family approaches Vito about partnering to sell drugs. Vito declines. But Sonny, quick to react without thinking, jumps in and undermines his father’s position. After the meeting, Vito offers his son a lesson: “Never tell anyone outside the family what you’re thinking again.” But the lesson comes too late; the damage is already done. The dealer decides that if Vito can be taken out, Sonny will take the deal. Sonny’s indiscretion leads to an assassination attempt on Vito’s life, which critically wounds his father.

While Vito is in the hospital, Sonny becomes acting head of the family. True to his impulsive nature, he initiates an all-out war with the other families. Meanwhile, Carlo Rizzi continues to resent Sonny for beating him in front of his crew, and conspires with a rival family to kill him. Carlo baits

Sonny into reacting without reasoning, which leads to Sonny’s brutal assassination on the Jones Beach Causeway.

Sonny’s quick temper ultimately leads to his downfall, as it does for many people. When we respond without reasoning, we’re more likely to make mistakes that seem obvious in hindsight. In fact, when we respond emotionally, we often don’t even realize that we’re in a position that calls for thinking at all. When you are possessed by the moment, all the reasoning tools in the world won’t help you.

From Emotion to Action

There’s a bit of Sonny in each of us. You experience anger, fear, or some other emotion, and feel compelled to act immediately. But in these moments, the action you’re pushed toward rarely serves you.

Anger at a rival prevents you from doing what’s in your own best interest. Fear of losing an opportunity pushes you to cut thinking short and act impulsively. Outrage at a criticism causes you to lash out in defense, alienating potential allies. The list goes on.

Emotions can multiply all of your progress by zero. It doesn’t matter how much you’ve thought about or worked at something, it can all be undone in an instant. No one is immune. The Olympian Matthew Emmons, for instance, was a prodigy who’d come to dominate the field of competitive rifle shooting. He was poised to win his second Olympic gold when the emotion default worked its mischief. Emmons was in the final round. He aimed. He fired. Bullseye. The only problem: he shot at the wrong target! Had it been the right one, he would’ve won the gold. Instead, he was awarded zero points and slipped to eighth place.

Afterward, Emmons said that he usually looked through the rifle scope at the number above the target to make sure it was the correct one before lowering the rifle to the bullseye. In this case, he’d skipped that crucial first step.

“On that shot,” he said, “I was just worrying about calming myself down . . . so I didn’t even look at the number.”[1] So he scored a point for

the emotion default, instead.

While Emmons’s Olympic loss is epic, it pales in comparison to the tragedy that unfolded in the life of a former colleague of mine. Let’s call him Steve. I noticed that Steve always seemed to shut down whenever politics came up during work dinners. One day, away from the group, I asked him why.

He told me a story I’d never forget. One night, Steve’s parents came over for dinner. When they started talking about politics and taxes, the conversation grew heated. Steve’s emotions soon took over, and he started saying things he probably didn’t mean. Things that couldn’t be unsaid. Things we might say when we’re reacting and not thinking.

That was the last conversation he ever had with his parents. On their way home, their car was struck head on by a drunk driver. Neither recovered. That night still haunts Steve to this day. It’s a memory that won’t go away, about an ordinary moment he’ll forever regret.

Emotions can make even the best of us into idiots, driving us away from clear thinking. They often have help, though. Later we’ll see some of the many inbuilt biological vulnerabilities that leave us even more exposed to the emotion default’s influence: sleep deprivation, hunger, fatigue, emotion, distraction, stress from feeling rushed, and being in an unfamiliar environment. If you find yourself in any of these conditions, be on your guard! The emotion default is likely running the show. We’ll also explore the safeguards that can protect you in such situations.

### Chapter 1.3: The Ego Default

CHAPTER 1.3

The Ego Default

going back to the godfather, carlo rizzi is an example of a different default at work: the ego.

Carlo becomes a member of the Corleone family when he marries Vito’s daughter, Connie. As an outsider, he occupies a relatively low position in the social hierarchy. Full of pride and ego, he becomes increasingly frustrated by his marginal role in the family business. This frustration leads him to take some unforgivable actions.

That’s just what happens in life sometimes; the ego default prompts us to promote and protect our self-image at all costs.

In Carlo’s case, being reminded of his low status in the family combines with his desire to defend his self-image (“I can do more than the job I’m in, but they won’t give me more”) and leads him to make the ultimate betrayal. Carlo never intended to tear the Corleone family apart from within. He just wanted a role in line with how he saw himself. The daily indignation of being treated as lesser set off a chain reaction he never intended.

Appearing Successful vs. Being Successful

Not all confidence is created equally. Sometimes, it comes from a track record of applying deep knowledge successfully, and other times it comes from the shallowness of reading an article. It’s amazing how often the ego turns unearned knowledge into reckless confidence.

A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing, as one of my kids learned the hard way. Not wanting to write out his homework in French, which would take a lot of time and effort, he realized he could write it out in English and put it through an online translator. When I asked him how he finished so quickly, he told me it was easy and left it at that. Of course, his French teacher realized what he had done and gave him a zero.

Our ego tempts us into thinking we’re more than we are. Left unchecked, it can turn confidence into overconfidence or even arrogance. We get a bit of knowledge on the internet and suddenly we are full of hubris. Everything seems easy. As a result, we take risks that we may not understand we’re taking. We must resist this kind of unearned confidence, though, if we are to get the results we desire.

Recently, after a talk I attended on the growing homeless population, the person sitting next to me commented on how easy it would be to solve this deep and complex issue. He was intoxicated with a little unearned confidence, based on shallow understanding, so the problem seemed simple to him. However, those with competence based on hard-earned knowledge didn’t think the problem was simple at all. They were fully aware of the realities of the situation.

Unearned knowledge rushes us to judgment. “I’ve got this,” we think. We convince ourselves that low-chance events are zero-chance events and think only of best-case outcomes. We feel immune to bad luck—to the bad things that happen to other people, because of our newfound (and false) sense of confidence.[1]

Confidence doesn’t make bad outcomes any less likely or good outcomes more likely, it only blinds us to risk. The ego also makes us more concerned with maintaining or improving our perceived position in a social hierarchy than with extending our knowledge or skills.

One reason people find it hard to empower others at work is that having them depend on us for every decision makes us feel important and indispensable. Having them depend on us makes us feel not only necessary but powerful. The more people who depend on us the more powerful we feel. However, this position is often self-defeating. Slowly and then all at

once we become a prisoner of the circumstances we created; more and more effort is needed to stay in the same place, and we approach the ceiling of brute force.[*] It’s only a matter of time until things break.

The person who wants to be seen as great shows the world how to manipulate them. We’re prone to being less concerned with actual greatness than with exuding the appearance of greatness. When someone steps on how we see ourselves (or how we want to be seen), the ego leaps into action, and we often react without reasoning. Carlo Rizzi is a fictional example, but there are many real ones.

In September 1780, for instance, the American general Benedict Arnold secretly met a British spy. In exchange for £20,000 and a British military command, Arnold agreed to give the British control of the fort at West Point, which was then under his command.

What powerful force could make someone betray his country? Arnold’s reason was the same as Carlo Rizzi’s: long-harbored resentment about his social standing.

Arnold had been an accomplished military officer, but he wasn’t generally well-liked. He had a jealous disposition and frequently complained about Congress promoting younger, less competent officers ahead of him. He was quick to react to social slights, both real and imagined. And his tendency to prove his superiority by humiliating people with whom he disagreed created an invisible army of enemies.

He nevertheless managed to earn the confidence of the Continental Army’s commander in chief, George Washington, who appointed Arnold military governor of Philadelphia. Around this time, Arnold sought the hand of Peggy Shippen, the daughter of a wealthy Philadelphia family.

The Shippens were loyalist sympathizers interested in making connections only with similarly wealthy people. Arnold, however, was not wealthy. His alcoholic father had squandered the family fortune when Arnold was a boy. Arnold had been trying to reestablish the family’s position in society ever since.

Arnold lived extravagantly, throwing lavish parties, with the hope of earning the respect of Philadelphia’s wealthy elite. He promised the

Shippens that he would bestow on Peggy a large sum in advance of their wedding as proof of his financial means, and took out a large mortgage to purchase a mansion. When Arnold and Peggy were finally married, Arnold was deeply in debt. He and Peggy couldn’t even occupy that mansion because he needed to rent it out to pay the mortgage.

Arnold’s lifestyle caught the attention of his many enemies, including Pennsylvania’s unscrupulous president of the Supreme Executive Council, Joseph Reed. Reed built a flimsy case against Arnold which, it seemed, was more intended to disgrace the man publicly than anything else. It turned out, however, that Arnold had been using his position as military governor to benefit himself financially. Eventually, his case was brought before a court martial. General Washington gave Arnold only a light reprimand, yet Arnold felt that Washington had betrayed him.

A short while later, he would go on to betray his country. Arnold’s pride had been wounded. He wanted to show others his value and importance. He wanted others to see him the way he saw himself. When they didn’t, he stopped exercising judgment, and ended up going down in history for all the wrong reasons.

Who hasn’t found themselves in a similar situation? Someone close to you doesn’t appreciate you the way you want to be appreciated. Perhaps they don’t see how insightful you are. Or maybe they don’t see how much you do for them. Desperate to satisfy the ego, either personally or professionally, you stop thinking and do things you otherwise wouldn’t, like approach a competitor or flirt with someone at a party. One example I’ve seen too many times in the workplace is when you stop putting in 100 percent of what you are capable of because you feel underappreciated.[*] The ego grabs your unconscious, throws your long-term goals out the window, and sets you sailing on a path toward destruction.

If Arnold hadn’t been so consumed by ego—had he instead reacted less and reasoned more—he might have seen that his long-term political objectives and his family’s well-being demanded a more modest way of life.

Feeling Right over Being Right

Our desire to feel right overpowers our desire to be right.

The ego default urges us to feel right at the expense of being right. Few things feel better than being right—so much so that we will unconsciously rearrange the world into arbitrary hierarchies to maintain our beliefs and feel better about ourselves. My first memory of doing so dates back to my days of working in a grocery store at age sixteen.

One particular customer would always treat the staff poorly. He’d drive up in his fancy car, park it illegally outside, and run in to get something. When there was a line, he’d rudely comment and raise his voice telling everyone to hurry up. We called him Mr. Rolex.

One day when he was waiting in my line, he told me to “hurry the f**k up because this Rolex doesn’t pay for itself.”

I’ll leave my reply out but let’s just say that it cost me a job. It was worth it, though, because the experience made me realize that some people organize their unconscious hierarchy by money and status. Those were the ways Mr. Rolex had of keeping the score to always come out on top.

I remember walking home that night thinking that while I might not have a job, at least I wasn’t like him. And at that moment I rearranged the world in such a way that I, the newly unemployed high school student without a car or a lavish wristwatch, came out on top. I had unconsciously organized the world in a way where I could be above him and feel better about myself.

Both of us reverted to the ego default that day. Most people go through life assuming that they’re right . . . and that people who don’t see things their way are wrong.[2] We mistake how we want the world to be with how it actually is. The subject doesn’t matter: we’re right about politics, other people, our memories; you name it. We mistake how we want the world to work for how it does work.

Of course, we can’t be right about everything all the time. Everyone makes mistakes or misremembers some things. But we still want to feel right all the time, and ideally get other people to reinforce that feeling.

Hence, we channel inordinate amounts of energy to proving to others—or ourselves—that we’re right. When this happens, we’re less concerned with outcomes and more concerned with protecting our egos.

Later I’ll discuss more about how to combat the ego default. For the time being, keep in mind how to recognize it when it rears its head. If you find yourself expending tremendous energy on how you are seen, if you often feel your pride being wounded, if you find yourself reading an article or two on a subject and thinking you’re an expert, if you always try to prove you’re right and have difficulty admitting mistakes, if you have a hard time saying “I don’t know,” or if you’re frequently envious of others or feel as though you’re never given the recognition you deserve—be on guard! Your ego is in charge.

### Chapter 1.4: The Social Default

CHAPTER 1.4

The Social Default

Where all think alike, no one thinks very much.

—WALTER LIPPMANN, The Stakes of Diplomacy

years ago, i witnessed a particularly ugly and grim talk at a conference. When it ended, others started clapping. I hesitated but tentatively joined them anyway. It would have felt awkward not to.[*]

The social default inspires conformity. It coaxes us to fall in line with an idea or behavior simply because other people do. It embodies what the term “social pressure” refers to: wanting to belong to the crowd, fear of being an outsider, fear of being scorned, fear of disappointing other people.

Our desire to fit in with the group comes from our history. Group interests were well served from a high level of conformity. But so too were our individual interests. Survival inside the tribe was hard but survival outside the tribe was impossible. Because we needed the group, our individual interests became secondary to the group interests. Though the world we live in today is very different from the one we evolved from, we still look to others for cues on how to behave.

The social rewards for going with the crowd are felt long before the benefits of going against it are gained. One measure of a person is the degree to which they’ll do the right thing when it goes against the popular belief. However, it is easy to overestimate our willingness to diverge from the crowd, and underestimate our biological instinct to fit in.

The social default encourages us to outsource our thoughts, beliefs, and outcomes to others. When everyone else is doing something, it’s easy to rationalize doing it too. No need to stand out, take responsibility for outcomes, or think for yourself. Just put your brain on autopilot and take a nap.

The social default inspires virtue signaling—getting other people to accept or praise your professed beliefs. Especially when there is no cost to such signals.

Princeton professor Robert George wrote, “I sometimes ask students what their position on slavery would have been had they been white and living in the South before abolition. Guess what? They all would have been abolitionists! They all would have bravely spoken out against slavery, and worked tirelessly against it.”[1]

No, they wouldn’t have. They may understandably want to send that signal now when it’s safe to do so, but back then they would have likely behaved the same most everyone else did at the time.[2]

Lemmings Rarely Make History

The social default makes us fear being snubbed, ridiculed, and treated like an idiot. In most people’s minds, this fear of losing social capital outweighs any potential upsides of deviating from the social norm and disposes them to accept it.[3]

Fear holds us back from taking risks and reaching our potential. No one grows up saying I want to do the same thing everyone else is doing. And yet there is a comfort to surrounding yourself with people who agree with you, or who are doing the same thing you’re doing. So while there is sometimes embedded wisdom in the crowd, mistaking the comfort of the collective for evidence that what you’re doing is going to lead to better results is the social default’s big lie.

The only way to outperform if you’re doing undifferentiated work is to work harder than everyone else. Imagine a team of ditchdiggers working with their hands. A slight variation in the amount of soil moved per hour is

barely perceptible. Your work is indistinguishable from that of the person next to you. The only way to move more dirt is to dig for longer. Within this paradigm, the ditchdigger who takes a week off to experiment and invent the shovel seems crazy. Not only do they look like a fool for taking a risk, but their cumulative production falls behind for every day they are not digging. Only when the shovel comes along do others see its advantage. Success requires shamelessness. So too does failure.

Doing something different means you might underperform, but it also means you might change the game entirely.

If you do what everyone else does, you’ll get the same results that everyone else gets.[*] Best practices aren’t always the best. By definition, they’re average.

If you don’t know enough about what you’re doing to make your own decisions, you probably should do what everyone is doing. If you want better-than-average results, though, you’ll have to think clearly. And thinking clearly is thinking independently. Sometimes you have to break free of the social default and do something differently from those around you. Fair warning: it’s going to get uncomfortable.

Our desire to fit in often overpowers our desire for a better outcome. Instead of trying something new, we tell ourselves something new.

Deviating from established practices can be painful. Who wants to try something different that might not work? We could end up losing people’s respect, their friendship, and even our job if we deviate too far from the status quo without producing the right results. This is why we rarely try new approaches, and when we do, we often proceed with so much trepidation that the smallest setback sends us back to the safety blanket of conformity.

It’s easy to take comfort in the fact that other people agree with us. As legendary investor Warren Buffett pointed out, though, “The fact that other people agree or disagree with you makes you neither right nor wrong. You will be right if your facts and reasoning are correct.”

The people executing established practices say they want new ideas, but they just don’t want the bad ones. And because they so want to avoid the

bad ones, they never deviate enough to find new good ones.

While we need divergence from the norm to make progress, not all divergence is advantageous. To be successful, it’s not enough to do something different; you also need to be right. To do something different, you need to think different. And that means you will stand out.[*]

Lou Brock might have put it best when he said, “Show me a guy who’s afraid to look bad, and I’ll show you a guy you can beat every time.” In other words, someone who’s possessed by the social default is easy to defeat.

Warren Buffett similarly highlighted the effects of the social default in his 1984 letter to Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholders:

Most managers have very little incentive to make the intelligent-but- with-some-chance-of-looking-like-an-idiot decision. Their personal gain/loss ratio is all too obvious: if an unconventional decision works out well, they get a pat on the back and, if it works out poorly, they get a pink slip. (Failing conventionally is the route to go; as a group, lemmings may have a rotten image, but no individual lemming has ever received bad press.)[4]

Lemmings might make small changes, sure, but not the changes they need in order to make an outsize impact. While they’ll talk about how they’re doing great things to change the course of events, when you dig beneath the surface, things are the same as before. What’s really changed is the marketing.

Change happens only when you’re willing to think independently, when you do what nobody else is doing, and risk looking like a fool because of it. Once you realize you’ve been doing what everyone else is doing—and only because they’re already doing it—it’s time to try something new.

Later I’ll discuss more examples of how the social default operates and how to combat it. For the time being keep the following in mind: if you find yourself exerting energy to fit in with a crowd, if you’re frequently fearful of disappointing other people, if you’re afraid of being an outsider, or if the

threat of scorn fills you with dread, then beware! The social default is in charge.

### Chapter 1.5: The Inertia Default

CHAPTER 1.5

The Inertia Default

The great enemy of any attempt to change men’s habits is inertia. Civilization is limited by inertia.

— EDWARD L. BERNAYS, Propaganda

in the mid-2000s, i invested a significant portion of my net worth into a small restaurant chain. A large investor had bought a controlling stake in the company and managed to turn around the operations, but those changes weren’t yet reflected in the company’s stock price. The CEO said and did all the right things. It was a compelling opportunity, so I went all in.

Over the subsequent years, however, the CEO’s attitude changed. What began as a fair partnership turned into a dictatorship. Like a pot of water coming to boil, the change was slow and hard to notice until, all of a sudden, it was boiling over.

I’d made multiples on the investment and believed in its future, so I was hesitant to exit the position too quickly—but eventually the facts became overwhelming, and I had to sell. After a bit of success, the ego default had taken control of the CEO. Suddenly all partners weren’t exactly equal, one was better than the rest.[*]

Changing my mind took a while. Each transgression by the CEO was minor and easy to explain away. It was only after I’d stepped away from the situation and began viewing it with some perspective that I realized how far the behavior had gone. I was lucky to get out before it became apparent to everyone else—I came awfully close to losing a whole lot of money.[*]

The inertia default pushes us to maintain the status quo. Starting something is hard but so too is stopping something.[1] We resist change even when change is for the best.

The Latin word inertia means literally “inertness”: that is, laziness or idleness. In physics, “inertia” refers to an object resisting a change in its state of motion. Hence, a popular way of stating Newton’s first law of motion—the law of inertia—is this: “A body in motion tends to stay in motion, and a body at rest tends to stay at rest.”

Objects never change if they’re left alone. They don’t start moving on their own, nor do they stop moving till something stops them.[*] This law of physics can also be applied to human behavior and our instinct to resist even beneficial change. The physicist Leonard Mlodinow sums it up this way: “Once our minds are set in a direction, they tend to continue in that direction unless acted upon by some outside force.”[2] This cognitive inertia is why changing our minds is hard.

Inertia keeps us in jobs we hate and in relationships that don’t make us happy, because in both cases we know what to expect and it’s comforting to have our expectations reliably met.

One reason we resist change is that keeping things the way they are requires almost no effort. This helps explain why we get complacent. It takes a lot of effort to build momentum but far less to maintain it. Once something becomes “good enough,” we can stop the effort and still get decent results. The inertia default leverages our desire to stay in our comfort zone, relying on old techniques or standards even when they’re no longer optimal.

Another reason we tend to push back against change is that doing something different might lead to worse results. There is an asymmetry to change—we take negative results to heart more than positive ones. Worse results make us stand out for the wrong reasons. Why risk looking like an idiot when you can remain average? We’d rather be average than risk the possibility of landing somewhere below average.

Inertia is evident in many of our daily habits, such as when we stick to the same grocery store brand even if a new, superior one appears on the

market. This reluctance to try new products is often due to the uncertainty and effort involved in evaluating them. To combat this, companies often offer free samples to customers, which serves as a low-risk way for them to try a new product and evaluate its quality without the fear of disappointment.

We like to think we’re open-minded and willing to change our beliefs when the facts change, but history has shown otherwise. When the automobile was first introduced, many critics dismissed it as a mere fad, arguing that horses and carriages were a more reliable mode of transportation. Similarly, when the airplane was first invented, people were skeptical of its practicality and safety. The radio, television, and internet all faced similar initial skepticism, yet despite this, each of these inventions has had a profound impact on the way we live today.

The “zone of average” is a dangerous place when it comes to inertia. It’s the point where things are working well enough that we don’t feel the need to make any changes. We hope things will magically improve. Of course, they rarely do. For example, staying in a relationship that is too good to leave and too bad to stay is a perfect example of the zone of average. If things were much worse, we would act, but since they’re not terrible, we stay, and hope things get better.

Doubling Down When You’re Wrong

As the famous quote often falsely attributed to Charles Darwin goes, “It’s not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change.”[3] Even though it’s a misquotation, it’s not useless just because it’s not Darwin.

When circumstances change, we need to adapt. But inertia closes minds and stifles the motivation to change how we’ve been doing things. It makes it harder to imagine alternative methods, and discourages experimentation and course correction.

For instance, public statements can create inertia. Putting something on the record establishes expectations along with social pressure to meet those

expectations. When new information challenges one of our statements, we might instinctively dismiss it and emphasize the old information that supported it. We want to be consistent with what we said. Changing our minds becomes increasingly difficult. We witness how, say, people label a politician a “flip-flopper” instead of “intelligent” when they change their position in response to the facts, and our fear of the social implications of changing our minds continues to grow.

Inertia also prevents us from doing hard things. The longer we avoid the hard thing we know we should do, the harder it becomes to do. Avoiding conflict is comfortable and easy. The longer we avoid the conflict, however, the more necessary it becomes to continue avoiding it. What starts out as avoiding a small but difficult conversation quickly grows into avoiding a large and seemingly impossible one. The weight of what we avoid eventually affects our relationship.

Groups create inertia of their own. They tend to value consistency over effectiveness, and reward people for maintaining the status quo. Inertia makes deviating from group norms difficult. The threat of standing out in a negative way too often keeps people in line. As a result, group dynamics end up favoring people who don’t deviate from the defaults.

Group inertia is partly responsible for why a friend of mine, and I suspect a host of others, got married in the first place. According to him, in hindsight, “All the signs were there that it might not work out, but it seemed like a lot to start over with someone new, and everyone around us was getting engaged, so that’s what we did.”

The influence of inertia isn’t just troubling in our work and relationships, it can also be bad for our health. In 1910, America’s leading expert on industrial toxicology, Alice Hamilton, was appointed to head a survey on industrial illness in the state of Illinois. Over the next few years, she provided definitive evidence of the dangers of lead exposure in the workplace and of lead-tainted exhaust fumes from automobiles. But despite the evidence, General Motors and other car manufacturers continued producing lead-fueled vehicles. It wasn’t until the 1980s that the US finally

banned leaded fuel. Even today, lead continues to be used for other applications, despite the availability of nontoxic options at a similar price.[4]

Inertia keeps us doing things that don’t get us what we want. It operates in our subconscious largely undetected until its effects are too hard to counter. Later I’ll discuss more examples of the inertia default at work and how to combat it. For the time being keep the following in mind: if you find yourself biting your tongue in group situations, if you find yourself or your team resisting change or continuing to do something in one way simply because that’s how you’ve always done it in the past—be on your guard! The inertia default is likely at work.

CHAPTER 1.6

Default to Clarity

A man can do as he wills, but not will as he wills.

—ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER

while we can’t eliminate our defaults, we can reprogram them. if we want to improve our behavior, accomplish more of our goals, and experience greater joy and meaning in our lives, we need to learn to manage our defaults.

The good news is that the same biological tendencies that make us react without reasoning can be reprogrammed into forces for good.

Think of your default patterns of thinking, feeling, and acting as algorithms you’ve been programmed to run unconsciously in response to inputs from other people or the environment. We don’t think about moving our knee when the doctor hits it with a reflex hammer. It just moves. The same thing happens with your thoughts and actions. We receive some type of input from the world and then execute an algorithm that processes that input and automatically produces an output.

Many of the algorithms you’re running have been programmed into you by evolution, culture, ritual, your parents, and your community. Some of these algorithms help move you closer to what you want; others move you further away.

You unconsciously adopt the habits of the people you spend time with, and those people make it easier or harder for you to achieve progress

toward what you want to achieve. The more time you spend with people, the more likely you start to think and act as they do.

Eventually, almost everyone loses the battle with willpower; it’s only a matter of time. Consider my parents. Neither of them smoked when they joined the armed forces, but it didn’t take long for them to follow the lead of their smoking coworkers. At first, they resisted, but as the days turned into weeks, the grind of constantly saying no wore them down. Decades later, quitting proved nearly impossible because everyone around them smoked. The very same force that encouraged them to start was now preventing them from stopping. They were only able to kick their habit when they changed their environment. They had to find new friends whose default behavior was their desired behavior.

That’s just how it goes sometimes when we’re forming or breaking habits. What may look like discipline often involves a carefully created environment to encourage certain behaviors. And what may look like poor choices is often just someone trying their best to use willpower and bumping up against their defaults. The people with the best defaults are typically the ones with the best environment. Sometimes it’s part of a deliberate strategy, and sometimes it’s just plain luck. Either way, it’s easier to align yourself with the right behavior when everyone else is already doing it.

The way to improve your defaults isn’t by willpower but by creating an intentional environment where your desired behavior becomes the default behavior.

Joining groups whose default behaviors are your desired behavior is an effective way to create an intentional environment. If you want to read more, join a book club. If you want to run more, join a running club. If you want to exercise more, hire a trainer. Your chosen environment, rather than your willpower alone, will help nudge you toward the best choices.

It’s easier said than done, though. Reprogramming a computer is simply a matter of rewriting lines of code, while reprogramming yourself is a longer and more involved process. It’s this process that I describe in the chapters that follow.
