DRUGS

You want it . . . but will you like it?

In which dopamine overwhelms reason to create consuming desire for the

most destructive behaviors imaginable.

A guy walks past a restaurant, smells burgers cooking. He imagines taking a bite; he can almost taste it. He’s on a diet, but at this point he can’t think of anything he wants more than that hamburger, so he goes in and orders one. Sure enough, the first bite is wonderful, but the second bite, not so much. With each bite, his enjoyment is less and less—so much for the hoped-for “hamburger heaven.” He finishes anyway, not really knowing why, then feels a little nauseated and very much defeated because he didn’t stick to his diet.

As he heads back into the street, the thought crosses his mind: there’s a big difference between wanting something and liking it.

WHO’S IN CONTROL OF YOUR BRAIN?

At some point, everyone asks the question, why? Why do I do the things that I do? Why do I make the choices that I make?

On the surface, this seems like an easy question: we do things for a reason. We put on a sweater because we’re cold. We get up in the morning and go to work because we need to pay the bills. We brush our teeth to prevent tooth decay. Most of what we do is for the sake of other things; things such as feeling warm, having money to pay bills, and to avoid being scolded by the dentist.

The problem is that you can ask this question as long as you like. Why do we want to stay warm? Why do we care if we pay the bills? Why do we want to avoid the dentist’s scolding? Children play this game all the time: “It’s time to go to bed.” Why? “Because you need to get up for school in the morning.” Why? “Because you need an education.” Why? And so on.

The philosopher Aristotle played this same game, but with a more serious purpose. He looked at all the things we do for the sake of something else and wondered if there was an end to it all. Why do you go to work, really? Why do you need to make money? Why do you have to pay bills? Why do you want the electricity to stay on? Where does it end? Is there anything we seek for itself only, not because it leads to something else? Aristotle decided there was. He decided there was a single thing that lay at the end of every string of Whys, and its name was Happiness. Everything we do, ultimately, is for the sake of happiness.

It’s hard to argue with this conclusion. After all, it makes us happy to be able to pay our bills and have electricity. It makes us happy to have healthy teeth and educated minds. It may even make us happy to suffer pain, if we’re doing it for a worthy cause. Happiness is the polestar that guides our journey through life. When faced with a range of options, we choose the one that leads to the most happiness.

Except we don’t. Our brains aren’t wired that way. Think of how many people you know who just “fell into” their careers, or who chose their college based on nothing but a gut feeling that it was the right one. Only once in a while do we sit down to consider our options rationally, weighing one against the other. Such an exercise is tiring work, and the outcome is rarely satisfying. We seldom reach the point at which we can say with certainty that we made the right decision. It’s much easier just to do what we want, so that’s what we do.

The next question, of course, becomes, “Well, then, what do we want?” The answer depends on whom you ask: one person might want to be rich, another might want to be a good father. The answer depends on when you ask, too. The 7:00 PM answer might be “dinner”; the 7:00 AM answer might be “another 10 minutes of sleep.” Sometimes people don’t know what they want at all; other times they want lots of things at once—things that they cannot have at the same time, because they conflict with one another. Most people, when they see a donut, want to eat it. Most people, when they see a donut, want to not eat it. What’s going on?

HOW TO STAY ALIVE

Andrew was a young man in his twenties who worked for a company that sold enterprise software. He had a confident, outgoing personality, and was one of the top salespeople in the company. He was so consumed with his work that he spent almost no time relaxing or pursuing other activities, except one: picking up women. He estimated that he had slept with over a hundred women but had never experienced an intimate relationship with any of them. It was something he longed for, something he knew was important for his long-term happiness, and he recognized that continuing his pattern of one-night stands wasn’t going to get him there. Nevertheless, the pattern continued.

Wanting, or desire, flows from an evolutionarily old part of the brain deep inside the skull called the ventral tegmental area. It is rich in dopamine; in fact, it is one of the two main dopamine-producing regions. Like most brain cells, the cells that grow there have long tails that wind through the brain until they reach a place called the nucleus accumbens. When these long- tailed cells are activated, they release dopamine into the nucleus accumbens, driving the feeling we know as motivation. The scientific term for this circuit is the mesolimbic pathway, although it’s easier to simply call it the dopamine desire circuit (Figure 1).

Figure 1

This dopamine circuit evolved to promote behaviors that lead to survival and reproduction, or, to put it more plainly, to help us get food and sex, and to win competitions. It’s the desire circuit that’s activated when you see the plate of donuts on the table, and it’s activated not by need, but by the presence of something attractive from an evolutionary or life-sustaining standpoint. That is, at the moment such a thing is seen, the circuit is activated whether or not you’re hungry. That’s the nature of dopamine. It’s always focused on acquiring more of everything with an eye toward providing for the future. Hunger is something that happens here and now, in the present. But dopamine says, “Go ahead and eat the donut, even if you’re not hungry. It will increase your chance of staying alive in the future. Who knows when food will be available next?” That made sense for our evolutionary ancestors, who lived most of their lives on the brink of starvation.

For a biological organism, the most important goal related to the future is to be alive when it comes. As a result, the dopamine system is more or less obsessed with keeping us alive. It constantly scans the environment for new sources of food, shelter, mating opportunities, and other resources that will keep our DNA replicating. When it finds something that’s potentially valuable, dopamine switches on, sending the message Wake up. Pay

attention. This is important. It sends this message by creating the feeling of desire, and often excitement. The sensation of wanting is not a choice you make. It is a reaction to the things you encounter.

The man walking past the burger place smelled food, and although other priorities may have been floating around in his mind, dopamine gave him a near-overwhelming urge—he wanted that burger. Although the focus was different, this is the same mechanism that was working in our brains thousands of years ago. Imagine one of our ancestors walking along the savanna. It’s a clear morning. The sun is coming up, the birds are singing, and everything is as it usually is. She walks along, looking without seeing, her mind wandering, when suddenly she stumbles upon a clump of bushes that are covered with berries. She’s seen these bushes a dozen times before, but they never had berries on them. In the past her eyes slipped over these bushes, her thoughts somewhere else, but now she’s paying attention. Her concentration sharpens as her eyes scan back and forth across the bushes, taking in all the details. Excitement wells up inside her. The future just became a little more secure because the bush with the dark green leaves makes fruit.

The desire circuit, powered by dopamine, has sprung into action. She’s going to remember this place where the berry bushes grow. From now on, whenever she sees this bush, a little dopamine will be released to make her more alert and to give her a hint of excitement, the better to motivate her to acquire this thing that can help her stay alive. An important memory has been formed: important because it’s linked to survival, important because it was triggered by the release of dopamine. But what happens when dopamine gets out of control?

WHY WE LIVE IN A WORLD OF PHANTOMS

When Andrew saw an attractive woman, getting her into bed became the most interesting thing in his life. Everything else faded into dull gray. He typically met women in bars, and when he wasn’t working, bars were where he wanted to be. Sometimes he told himself he was going to just relax and have a few beers. He liked the ambience, and there were times when he fought hard against the temptation to pick

someone up. He knew that as soon as the sex was over, he would lose interest in the young woman, and he disliked that feeling. But in spite of knowing how things would turn out, he usually gave in.

After a while things got even worse. He was losing interest the moment the woman agreed to go home with him. The chase had come to an end, and everything was different. To his eyes, she even looked different, a transformation that occurred in the blink of an eye. By the time they got to his apartment he no longer wanted to have sex with her.

In a broad sense, saying something is “important” is another way of saying it’s linked to dopamine. Why? Because among the many things it does, dopamine is an early-warning system for the appearance of anything that can help us survive. When something useful to our continued existence appears, we don’t have to think about it. Dopamine makes us want it, right now. It doesn’t matter if we’re going to like it, or if we even need it at the moment. Dopamine doesn’t care. Dopamine is like the little old lady who always buys toilet paper. It doesn’t matter if she has a thousand rolls stacked in the pantry. Her attitude is you can never have too much toilet paper. So it is with dopamine, but instead of toilet paper, dopamine urges you to possess and accumulate anything that might help keep you alive.

This explains why the man on the diet wanted that hamburger even though he wasn’t hungry. It explains why Andrew couldn’t stop pursuing women even though he knew that in just a few hours, maybe in just a few minutes, it would make him unhappy. But it also explains more nuanced things; for instance, why we remember some names but not others. There are all sorts of tricks one can use to make remembering easier, such as using the person’s name in conversation a few times. But even if the name seems committed to memory, it almost always fades quickly. Important names— those of people who can affect our lives—are easier. The name of the person who flirted with you at the party will stay in your memory longer than the name of the person who ignored you. So will the name of the man who told you to set up an appointment to see him because he wants to give you a job—and his name will stick with you even more reliably if you’re unemployed. Similarly, male rats remember the correct route through a maze more easily if there is a sexually receptive female at the other end. Sometimes the intensity of focus can be so great that your attention will get

stuck on things that don’t matter at the expense of things that do. A man who had a Beretta 9mm handgun pointed at his face during a robbery was asked to describe his assailant. He said, “I don’t remember his face, but I can describe the gun.”

Under more normal conditions, though, dopamine activation in the desire circuit triggers energy, enthusiasm, and hope. It feels good. In fact, some people spend the majority of their lives pursuing this feeling—a feeling of anticipation, a feeling that life is about to get better. You’re about to eat a delicious dinner, see an old friend, make a big sale, or receive a prestigious award. Dopamine turns on the imagination, producing visions of a rosy future.

What happens when the future becomes the present—when the dinner is in your mouth or your lover is in your arms? The feelings of excitement, enthusiasm, and energy dissipate. Dopamine has shut down. Dopamine circuits don’t process experience in the real world, only imaginary future possibilities. For many people it’s a letdown. They’re so attached to dopaminergic stimulation that they flee the present and take refuge in the comfortable world of their own imagination. “What will we do tomorrow?” they ask themselves as they chew their food, oblivious to the fact that they’re not even noticing this meal they had so eagerly anticipated. To travel hopefully is better than to arrive is the motto of the dopamine enthusiast.

The future isn’t real. It’s made up of a bundle of possibilities that exist only in our minds. Those possibilities tend to be idealized—we usually don’t imagine a mediocre outcome. We tend to think about the best of all possible worlds, and that makes the future more attractive. On the other hand, the present is real. It’s concrete. It’s experienced, not imagined, and that requires a different set of brain chemicals—the H&Ns, the here-and- now neurotransmitters. Dopamine makes us want things with a passion, but it’s the H&Ns that allow us to appreciate them: the flavors, colors, textures, and aromas of a five-course meal, or the emotions we experience when we spend time with people we love.

WANTING VERSUS LIKING

The transition from excitement to enjoyment can be challenging. Think of buyer’s remorse, the sense of regret that occurs after making a big purchase. Traditionally it has been attributed to the fear of having made the wrong choice, guilt over extravagance, or a suspicion of having been too influenced by the seller. In fact, it’s an example of the desire circuit breaking its promise. It told you that if you bought that expensive car you’d be overcome with joy, and your life would never be the same. Except, once you became its owner, those feelings were neither as intense nor as long lasting as you had hoped. The desire circuit often breaks its promises— which is bound to happen, because it plays no role in generating feelings of satisfaction. It is in no position to make dreams come true. The desire circuit is, so to speak, just a salesman.

As we anticipate a desired purchase, our future-oriented dopamine system is activated and creates excitement. Once possession is achieved, the desired object moves from the look up extrapersonal space to the look down peripersonal space; from the future, distant realm of dopamine, and into the consummatory, near-body realm of H&N. Buyer’s remorse is the failure of the H&N experience to compensate for the loss of dopaminergic arousal. If we made a wise purchase, it’s possible that strong H&N gratification will make up for the loss of the dopamine thrill. Alternatively, another way to avoid buyer’s remorse is to purchase something that triggers more dopaminergic expectation, for example, a tool, like a new computer that will boost productivity, or a new jacket that will make you look amazing the next time you go out.

Thus we see three possible solutions to buyer’s remorse: (1) chase the dopamine high by buying more, (2) avoid the dopamine crash by buying less, or (3) strengthen the ability to transition from dopamine desire to H&N liking. In no case, though, is there any guarantee that the things we so desperately want will be things that we will enjoy having. Wanting and liking are produced by two different systems in the brain, so we often don’t like the things we want. That’s just what’s going on in a scene from the sitcom The Office in which Will Ferrell, as temporary boss Deangelo Vickers, cuts into a large cake:

Deangelo: I, for one, love the corners. He slices off a corner, and eats it with his hand.

Deangelo: Why did I just do that? It’s not even that good. I don’t even want it. I had cake for lunch. He throws what’s left in his hand into the trash. Deangelo (sinking his fingers into the cake, and grabbing another handful): No. You know what? I’ve been good. I deserve this. He pauses, then: Deangelo: What am I doing? C’mon, Deangelo! He throws that handful away, too, then turns back to the cake. He leans down to the cake so he can yell at it. DeAngelo: No! No!

Distinguishing between what we want and what we like can be difficult, but the disconnect is most dramatic when people become addicted to drugs.

HIJACKING THE DESIRE CIRCUIT

Since he spent so much time prowling for women, Andrew spent most of his free time in bars. When he was in college, he would go to keg parties where he drank until the early morning hours, so walking around with a beer in his hand felt natural. After graduation most of his drinking buddies moved on to other things. Alcohol no longer played a central role in their lives. But Andrew, for whom a bar was like home, kept at it. When he found someone he was interested in, he drank faster. Under the influence of a bright pair of eyes the world became a more exciting place, fueling his enjoyment of alcohol.

He knew that his drinking had become a problem when his morning hangovers made it hard for him to give his best at work. His sales began to slip, and his therapist advised him to take a break from drinking. The therapist recommended that Andrew try it for thirty days so he could experience what it was like to be sober. The therapist knew that if a heavy drinker can do this, he usually feels better—clearheaded, full of energy, better able to enjoy the simple pleasures in life—and that this feeling increases motivation for long- term sobriety. On the other hand, if a drinker can’t achieve thirty

days of sobriety, it’s an indication that he no longer has full control of his drinking. That can be an eye-opening experience that may persuade a drinker to get alcohol out of his life.

Andrew tried it, and had no difficulty abstaining—except when he was in a bar looking for someone to sleep with. There was something about the place, something about the familiar experience of the chase, that triggered powerful cravings. His therapist became more concerned and felt Andrew met the criteria for an alcohol use disorder. He asked Andrew to try going to a few Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.

Andrew disagreed with the diagnosis. He was focused on overcoming his compulsion for anonymous sex. He was confident that if he could get that under control, he wouldn’t have to go to bars anymore, and the alcohol problem would take care of itself. The therapy took a long time, and despite repeated discussions with his therapist, his drinking increased. Eventually, though, he attained his goal. He met someone who captured his interest, and to his delight the interest didn’t fade. After a few fits and starts he completely gave up one-night stands. He no longer went out to bars much, but he was surprised to find that the drinking continued. The drinking had wormed its way into his brain, rewired his circuits, and now he couldn’t stop.

Like a guided missile, addictive drugs hit the desire circuit with an intense chemical blast. No natural behavior can match that. Not food, not sex, not anything.

Alan Leshner, the former director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, said that drugs “hijack” the desire circuit. They stimulate it far more intensely than natural rewards like food or sex, which affect the same brain- motivation system. That’s why food and sex addictions have so much in common with addiction to drugs. Brain circuits that evolved for the crucial purpose of keeping us alive are taken over by an addictive chemical, and repurposed to enslave the addict that gets caught in its net.

Drug abuse is like cancer: it starts small but can quickly take over every aspect of a user’s life. An alcoholic may start out as a moderate drinker. As he moves step by step from, say, a few beers on the weekend to a liter of vodka every day, other aspects of his life get swallowed up. At first he stops

going to his son’s baseball games so he can stay home and drink. After a while the parent–teacher conferences go, then all family activities, and last of all work, since that supplies money to buy the alcohol. But in the end even work goes. Like a tumor, the addiction has spread, and the alcoholic’s entire life becomes focused exclusively on drinking. Was he making rational choices? From the outside it doesn’t look like it.

But from the inside, where we see dopamine in action, it makes perfect sense.

The dopamine system evolved to motivate us to survive and reproduce. For most people there is nothing more important than staying alive and keeping their children safe. These are the activities that produce the largest dopamine surges. In a very literal way, large dopamine surges signal the need to react to life-and-death situations. Take shelter. Find food. Protect your children. These are tasks that hit the dopamine system hard. What could be more important?

To an addict, drugs are more important. At least that’s the way it feels. That guided-missile dopamine blast overwhelms everything else. If making decisions is like weighing options on a balance, an addictive drug is an elephant sitting down on one side of the scale. Nothing else can compete.

An addict chooses drugs over work, family, everything. You think he’s making irrational choices but his brain is telling him that his choices are perfectly logical. If someone offered you a choice between a meal at a nice restaurant, even the nicest restaurant in town, and a check for million dollars, it’s ridiculous to think you’d choose dinner. That’s exactly how an addict feels when choosing between, say, paying the rent and buying crack. He chooses the one that will lead to the bigger dopamine hit. The euphoria of crack cocaine is bigger than just about any experience you can name. That’s rational from the point of view of desire dopamine, which is what drives the behavior of addicts.

Drugs are fundamentally different from natural dopamine triggers. When we’re starving, there’s nothing more motivating than getting food. But after we eat, the motivation for getting food declines because satiety circuits become active and shut down the desire circuit. There are checks and balances in place to keep everything stable. But there’s no satiety circuit for crack. Addicts take drugs until they pass out, get sick, or run out of money. If you ask an addict how much crack he wants, there is only one answer: more.

Let’s look at it from another angle. The goal of the dopamine system is to predict the future and, when an unexpected reward occurs, to send a signal that says, “Pay attention. It’s time to learn something new about the world.” In this way, circuits bathed in dopamine become malleable. They morph into new patterns. New memories are laid down, new connections are established. “Remember what happened,” says the dopamine circuit. “This may be useful in the future.”

What’s the end result? You don’t get surprised the next time the reward occurs. When you discovered the website that streamed your favorite music, it was exciting. But the next time you visited the site it wasn’t. There’s no longer any reward prediction error. Dopamine is not meant to be an enduring reservoir of joy. By shaping the brain to make surprising events predictable, dopamine maximizes resources, as it is supposed to do, but in the process, by eliminating surprise and extinguishing reward-prediction error, it suppresses its own activity.

But addictive drugs are so powerful that they bypass the complicated circuitry of surprise and prediction and artificially ignite the dopamine system. In this way, they scramble everything up. All that’s left is a gnawing craving for more.

Drugs destroy the delicate balance that the brain needs to function normally. Drugs stimulate dopamine release no matter what kind of situation the user is in. That confuses the brain, and it begins to connect drug use to everything. After a while, the brain becomes convinced that drugs are the answer to all aspects of life. Feel like celebrating? Use drugs. Feeling sad? Use drugs. Hanging out with a friend? Use drugs. Feeling stressed, bored, relaxed, tense, angry, powerful, resentful, tired, energetic? Use drugs. People in twelve-step programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous say that addicts need to watch out for three things that might trigger craving and topple them into relapse: people, places, and things.

THE ADDICT WHO COULD NO LONGER

MAKE HIS CLOTHES WHITE AND BRIGHT

Cues among addicts can be strange things. One former drug user had to avoid watching cartoons because his dealer printed cartoon characters on the drug packages he sold. Sometimes addicts don’t even know what’s triggering their craving. A struggling heroin addict found that he was overcome with craving every time he went to the grocery store. He had no idea why. It was causing havoc with his treatment. One day he and his counselor went on a field trip to the grocery store to try to figure out what was going on. The counselor told her patient to let her know as soon as the craving hit. They walked up and down each aisle, one by one, until suddenly the patient stopped and said, “Now.” They were in the laundry detergent aisle, standing in front of a shelf full of bleach. Before he entered treatment, the addict had reused hypodermic needles by soaking them in bleach to avoid HIV infection.

THE REASON ADDICTS THINK SMOKING CRACK IS BETTER

THAN SNORTING COCAINE

The ability to trigger dopamine in the desire circuit is what makes a drug addictive. Alcohol does it, heroin does it, cocaine does it, even marijuana does it. Not all drugs trigger dopamine to the same degree, though. The ones that hit dopamine the hardest are more addictive than ones that are more restrained. By triggering the release of more dopamine, the “hard hitters” also make the user feel more euphoric, and stimulate the most intense craving when the drug is gone. Intensity varies by drug. Pot smokers are generally less desperate to get more of the drug than cocaine addicts. But beneath all the differences is the commonality of the dopaminergic rush and subsequent craving.

Many factors account for the differences. The chemical structure of the molecules that make up each drug plays a large role; some chemicals are better than others at pushing dopamine along its path. But there are other considerations as well. For example, the crack cocaine that users smoke is essentially the same molecule as powder cocaine that users snort, but crack

is far more addictive—so much so that when crack became widely available in the 1980s, it took the world of recreational drug use by storm.

What’s so “great” about crack that allowed it to take over the cocaine market, and chemically enslave thousands of people? From a scientific perspective, the answer is simple: the rate of onset of action.

Consider a drug such as alcohol that triggers the release of dopamine. The faster it gets into the brain, the higher it will make its user. In Figure 2 the horizontal axis shows how much time has gone by and the vertical axis shows how much drug has gotten into a user’s brain. If someone is sipping a glass of Chardonnay, the graph will gently rise to the right. On the other hand, if that same person were to start taking shots of vodka, the graph would show a steep slope that quickly shoots upward.

Figure 2

The slope of the line indicates how quickly the level of the drug—in this case, alcohol—is rising in the brain. And the faster the rise, the more dopamine release, the more euphoria, and the more craving down the road.

That’s why smoking crack is more appealing than snorting powder cocaine: smoking produces a faster, larger dopamine rush. Regular cocaine can’t be smoked; the heat destroys it. Transforming it into crack makes it smokable, so the drug gets in the body through the lungs instead of the nose. That makes a big difference.

When powdered cocaine flies up into the nose, it lands on the nasal mucosa, the red lining inside your nose. It’s red because the blood vessels are at the surface. Cocaine enters the bloodstream through these vessels, but it’s not very efficient; there isn’t much room available in there. Sometimes when a user snorts a line of cocaine, some of the powder never makes it into their system because there’s not enough space for it on the surface of the mucosa.

That’s not to say that snorting cocaine isn’t dangerous and addictive, but there’s a way to make it even more dangerous and more addictive: smoking it. Smoking cocaine as crack makes the process more efficient. Unlike the nasal mucosa, the surface area of the lungs is huge. Filled with hundreds of millions of tiny air sacs, the surface area is equal to one side of a tennis court. There’s plenty of room there, and when the vaporized cocaine hits the lungs, it goes right into the bloodstream and up to the brain. It’s a steep slope—a sudden burst—and a big hit to the dopamine system.

The link between a rapidly rising blood level and dopamine release is also why addicts progress to injecting drugs into their veins. Other routes of administration no longer give them the thrill they’re after. Injecting drugs is scary, though, and is a clear sign of an addict, so the stigma and fear of the needle may stop many of them from progressing further. Unfortunately, smoking gets the drug into the brain about as fast as intravenous injection. Smoking also lacks the stigma associated with needles. As a result, many would-be casual users of cocaine progress to life-destroying addiction. The same thing happened with methamphetamine when it became available in smokable form.

DRUNK VERSUS HIGH: WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE?

There’s a big difference between being high and being drunk, but not everyone knows that. Even fewer understand why.

An evening of drinking feels best at the start. The level of alcohol is rising rapidly, and that feels good—it’s dopaminergic euphoria, directly related to how fast the alcohol gets into the brain.

As the night goes on, though, the rate of increase slows down, and dopamine turns off. Euphoria gives way to drunkenness. The early stage of rising levels of alcohol might be characterized by increased energy, excitement, and pleasure. Intoxication, on the other hand, is characterized by sedation, poor coordination, slurred speech, and bad judgment. The speed with which alcohol gets into the brain determines how high a drinker feels. It’s the total amount of alcohol consumed, regardless of whether it’s fast or slow, that determines the level of intoxication.

Inexperienced drinkers get the two confused. They start drinking, push their blood alcohol level up, and experience the pleasures of dopamine release, then mistakenly believe that the pleasure is the pleasure of intoxication. So they keep drinking more and more, trying in vain to get the rush back. It ends badly, often bent over a toilet.

Some people figure this out on their own. A woman seen at a cocktail party said she always had more fun with mixed drinks than with beer. At first this appeared to be nonsense, because alcohol is alcohol whether it comes from a beer or a daiquiri. But science validates the woman’s experience. A mixed drink is more concentrated, and it’s usually sweetened with sugar, so people tend to drink it faster. Mixed drinks usually contain more alcohol than beer or wine. Therefore a mixed drink delivers a lot of alcohol fast, a burst of dopaminergic stimulation, as opposed to an evening of slowly increasing intoxication. This woman wanted elation, not inebriation, so of course the mixed drinks let her have a better time. She was getting a dopamine hit from a few cocktails that an evening of many beers couldn’t deliver.

THE CRAVING THAT NEVER STOPS

Although craving never stops as long as an addict keeps using drugs, the brain gradually loses its ability to deliver the high—the desire circuit simply

reacts less and less, so much so that they might as well replace the drug with salt water.1

Patrick Kennedy, the former U.S. representative for Rhode Island’s 1st Congressional District, and son of the late Massachusetts senator Ted Kennedy, understands the diminishing stimulation of drug use. Arguably the foremost advocate for brain research and improved mental health services in the United States, he himself struggled with addictions and mental illness, publicly acknowledging his problems after he drove into a barricade at the U.S. Capitol in the middle of the night. In a 60 Minutes interview with Lesley Stahl he spoke of the need to use, even in the absence of pleasure.

There’s no partying there. There’s no enjoyment. This is about relieving the pain. People have this mistaken notion that you get high. What you’re really getting is relief from the low.

This is why, even if an addict uses so much cocaine (or heroin or alcohol or marijuana) that it no longer leads to feeling high, he will continue to use it.

Remember the happy surprise of the bakery with the delicious croissants and coffee? You were walking along expecting nothing, something good appeared, and your dopamine system leaped into action—hence your “prediction” was wrong, and you experienced the burst of dopamine from reward prediction error. You started going to that bakery every day. Now imagine that you’re waiting in line for your morning coffee and croissant, and all of a sudden your phone rings. It’s your boss. There’s a crisis at work. Drop whatever you’re doing, she says, and get to the office right away. Assuming you’re a conscientious person, you’ll leave the bakery empty- handed, feeling resentful and deprived.

Now let’s say it’s Saturday night, and an addict’s brain is expecting the usual Saturday-night “treat,” cocaine, but it doesn’t come. Just like the croissant-deprived office worker, the drug-deprived addict will feel resentful and deprived.

When an expected reward fails to materialize, the dopamine system shuts down. In scientific terms, when the dopamine system is at rest, it fires at a leisurely three to five times per second. When it’s excited, it zooms up

to twenty to thirty times per second. When an expected reward fails to materialize, the dopamine firing rate drops to zero, and that feels terrible.

That’s why a dopamine shutdown makes you feel resentful and deprived. It’s how a recovering drug addict feels every day as he struggles to get clean and sober. It takes an enormous amount of strength, determination, and support to overcome addiction. Don’t mess with dopamine. It hits back hard.

DESIRE IS PERSISTENT, BUT HAPPINESS IS FLEETING

Giving in to craving doesn’t necessarily lead to pleasure because wanting is different from liking. Dopamine makes promises that it is in no position to keep. “If you buy these shoes, your life will change,” says the desire circuit, and it just might happen, but not because dopamine made you feel it.

Dr. Kent Berridge, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Michigan, is a pioneering figure in the process of disentangling dopamine desire circuits from here-and-now liking circuits. He found that when a rat tastes a sugar solution, it signals liking by licking its lips. In contrast, it expresses wanting by consuming more of the sweet liquid. When he injected a chemical into a rat’s brain that boosted dopamine, it consumed more sugar water, but didn’t show any increased signs of liking. On the other hand, when he injected an H&N booster, he was able to triple the lip-smacking liking response. All of a sudden the sugar water became far more delicious.

In an interview with The Economist, Dr. Berridge noted that the dopamine desire system is powerful and highly influential in the brain, whereas the liking circuit is tiny, fragile, and much harder to trigger. The difference between the two is the reason that “life’s intense pleasures are less frequent and less sustained than intense desire.”

Liking involves different circuits in the brain, and uses the H&N chemicals, not dopamine, to send messages. In particular, liking relies on the same chemicals that promote the long-term satisfaction of companionate love: endorphins and endocannabinoids. Because opioid drugs such as heroin and OxyContin scramble both the desire circuit and the liking circuit (where dopamine acts and where endorphin acts), they are among the most

addictive drugs there are. Marijuana is similar. It also interacts with both circuits, stimulating dopamine as well as the endocannabinoid system. This dual effect leads to unusual results.

Boosting dopamine can lead to enthusiastic engagement with things that would otherwise be perceived as unimportant. For example, marijuana users have been known to stand in front of a sink, watching water drip from the faucet, captivated by the otherwise mundane sight of the drops falling over and over again. The dopamine-boosting effect is also evident when marijuana smokers get lost in their own thoughts, floating aimlessly through imaginary worlds of their own creation. On the other hand, in some situations marijuana suppresses dopamine, mimicking what H&N molecules tend to do. In that case, activities that would typically be associated with wanting and motivation, such as going to work, studying, or taking a shower, seem less important.

IMPULSIVENESS AND THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL

Many of the decisions that addicts make, particularly the harmful decisions, are impulsive. Impulsive behavior occurs when too much value is placed on immediate pleasure and not enough on long-term consequences. Desire dopamine overpowers the more rational parts of the brain. We make choices that we know are not in our best interest, but we feel powerless to resist. It’s as if our free will has been compromised by an overwhelming urge for immediate pleasure; perhaps it’s a bag of potato chips when we’re on a diet, or splurging on an expensive night out that we can’t really afford.

Drugs that boost dopamine can also boost impulsive behavior. A cocaine addict once said, “When I do a line of cocaine, I feel like a new man. And the first thing that new man wants is another line of cocaine.” When the addict stimulates his dopamine system, his dopamine system responds by demanding more stimulation. That’s why most cocaine addicts smoke cigarettes when they use cocaine. Like cocaine, nicotine stimulates additional dopamine release, but it’s cheaper and easier to get.

Nicotine, in fact, is an unusual drug because it does very little except trigger compulsive use. According to researcher Roland R. Griffiths, PhD, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Johns Hopkins

University School of Medicine, “When you give people nicotine for the first time, most people don’t like it. It’s different from many other addictive drugs, for which most people say they enjoy the first experience and would try it again.” Nicotine doesn’t make you high like marijuana or intoxicated like alcohol or wired up like speed. Some people say it makes them feel more relaxed or more alert, but really, the main thing it does is relieve cravings for itself. It’s the perfect circle. The only point of smoking cigarettes is to get addicted so one can experience the pleasure of relieving the unpleasant feeling of craving, like a man who carries around a rock all day because it feels so good when he puts it down.

Addiction arises from the chemical cultivation of desire. The delicate system that tells us what we like or dislike is no match for the raw power of dopaminergic compulsion. The feeling of wanting becomes overwhelming and utterly detached from whether the object of desire is anything we really care for, is good for us, or might kill us. Addiction is not a sign of weak character or a lack of willpower. It occurs when the desire circuits get thrown into a pathological state by overstimulation.

Prod dopamine too hard and too long, and its power comes roaring out. Once it has taken charge of a life, it is difficult to tame.

THE PARKINSON’S PATIENT WHO LOST HIS HOME TO VIDEO

POKER

Recreational drugs aren’t the only ones that stimulate dopamine. There are prescription drugs that do it as well, and when they hit the desire circuit too hard, strange things can happen. Parkinson’s disease is an illness of dopamine deficiency in a pathway that’s responsible for controlling muscle movements. Or, to put it more simply, it’s how we translate our inner world of ideas into action, the way we impose our will upon the world. When there is not enough dopamine in this circuit, people become stiff and shaky, and they move slowly. The treatment is to prescribe drugs that boost dopamine.

Most people who take these drugs do just fine, but about one in six patients gets into trouble with high-risk, pleasure-seeking behavior. Pathological gambling, hypersexuality, and compulsive shopping are the

most common ways the excessive dopamine stimulation is seen. To explore this risk, British researchers gave a drug called L-dopa to fifteen healthy volunteers. L-dopa is made into dopamine inside the brain, and can be used to treat Parkinson’s disease. They gave another fifteen volunteers a placebo. Nobody knew who got the drug and who got the fake pill.

After they took the pills, the volunteers were given the opportunity to gamble. The researchers found that the participants who took the dopamine- boosting pill placed larger and riskier bets than those who took the placebo. The effect was more pronounced in men than in women. The researchers periodically asked the participants to rate how happy they were. There was no difference between the two groups. The enhanced dopamine circuit boosted impulsive behavior, but not satisfaction—it boosted the wanting, but not the liking.

When the scientists used powerful magnetic fields to look inside their participants’ brains, they found yet another effect: the more active the dopamine cells were, the more money the volunteers expected to win.

It’s not uncommon for people to deceive themselves in this way. There are few things we encounter in daily life that are more unlikely than winning the lottery. A person is more likely to have identical quadruplets, or be killed by a vending machine tipping over. It’s over a hundred times more likely that a person will be struck by lightning than win the lottery. Yet millions of people buy tickets. “Someone has to win,” they say. A more sophisticated dopamine enthusiast expressed his devotion to the lottery in this way: “It’s hope for a dollar.”

Expecting to win the lottery may be irrational, but far more severe distortions of judgment can occur when people take dopamine-boosting medicines every day:

On March 10, 2012, lawyers for Ian,2 a sixty-six-year-old resident of Melbourne, Australia, filed a statement of claim in federal court. He was suing the drug manufacturer Pfizer, claiming that their Parkinson’s medication, Cabaser, made him lose everything he had.

He was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 2003. His doctor prescribed Cabaser, and in 2004 Ian’s dose was doubled. That’s when the problems began. He started gambling heavily on video poker machines. He was retired, and received a modest pension of about $850 per month. Each month he fed the entire sum into the

machines, but it wasn’t enough. To pay for his compulsion, he sold his car for $829, pawned much of what he owned for $6,135, and borrowed $3,500 from friends and family. Next, he took out loans for over $50,000 from four financial institutions, and on July 7, 2006, he sold his home.

In all, this man of modest means gambled away over $100,000. He was finally able to stop in 2010, when he read an article about the link between Parkinson’s medication and gambling. He stopped taking Cabaser, and the problem went away.

Why do some people who take Parkinson’s medication engage in destructive behavior, but most do not? It’s possible they were born with a genetic vulnerability. People who gambled frequently in the past are more likely than others to experience out-of-control gambling after they start Parkinson’s medication, suggesting there are certain personality features that put people at risk.

Another risk of Parkinson’s medication is hypersexuality. A Mayo Clinic case series—the tracking of patients with a certain type of illness or treatment—described a fifty-seven-year-old man treated with L-dopa who “would have sexual intercourse twice daily and, when possible, even more often. Both he and his wife worked full time, and because of her busy schedule, she found it difficult to satisfy him.” After he retired at age sixty- two, things became worse. He made sexual advances to two young ladies in his extended family as well as to women in the neighborhood. Eventually, his wife had to leave her job to attend to his sexual urges.3

Yet another patient expressed his hypersexuality by spending hours every day in internet adult chat rooms—but even otherwise healthy people taking no medication at all are susceptible to the dopamine call of pornography, supercharged by the internet.

Of course, you don’t need Parkinson’s medication coursing through your brain to have your life upended by sexual obsession. Consider the fearsome triad of dopamine, technology, and porn.

MORE, MORE, MORE: DOPAMINE AND THE POWER OF

PORNOGRAPHY

Noah was a twenty-eight-year-old man who sought help because he was unable to stop viewing pornography. He grew up in a Catholic household, and the first time he was exposed to pornography was at the age of fifteen. He was on the internet searching for something unrelated when he ran across a picture of a naked woman. He said from that moment he was hooked.

At first, things weren’t too bad. He was accessing the internet over a dial-up modem and “it took ages for the pictures to load.” He was lucky. Technology was limiting his daily dose. He described the pictures he started with as “tame.” Over time, both of these would change. Broadband allowed him to access pictures instantly, and he could now add video to his daily routine. Tame material gave way to depictions of more extreme acts as his tolerance for pornographic thrills increased.

He considered his behavior to be a sin, a moral failing, and he used his relationship with the church to get his compulsion under control. He went to confession on a regular basis, and received emotional support that helped him cut back his viewing habits. But when his work assigned him to an overseas branch, everything fell apart. Unable to speak the local language, he became socially isolated, and his compulsion flared up worse than ever. He said, “What makes this so hard is the inner struggle, the conflict within. It’s a war against yourself.” Feeling completely out of control, he no longer believed it was a strictly moral failing. “I need to fight this on a chemical level because at some point I want to get married.”

Thanks to the internet, sexually graphic material is more easily available than ever before. Some people maintain that it is possible to become addicted to pornography, even for otherwise healthy people taking no medication at all. In 2015 the Daily Mail claimed that as many as one in twenty-five young adults in the United Kingdom were believed to be sex addicts.

A reporter from the newspaper spoke to researchers at the University of Cambridge who described experiments in which they had placed young men in brain scanners, and then piped in pornographic videos for them to watch. As expected, their dopamine circuits lit up. The circuits went back to normal when ordinary videos were displayed.

The scientists put other volunteers in front of a computer, and found that of all the content on the internet, pictures of undressed women were most likely to make young men click compulsively. They also discovered that showing people “highly arousing sexual pictures” was distracting when they were trying to pay attention to something else. (Amateur scientists can try this experiment at home.) At the end of the study they concluded that compulsive sexual behavior was fueled by easy access to sexual images on the internet.

THE POWER OF EASY ACCESS

When it comes to addiction, easy access matters. More people get addicted to cigarettes and alcohol than to heroin, even though heroin hits the brain in a way that is more likely to trigger addiction. Cigarettes and alcohol are a larger public health problem because they are so easy to obtain. In fact, the most effective way to reduce the problems caused by these substances is to make it more difficult to get them.

We’ve all seen “quit smoking” advertisements on buses and subways. They don’t work. We’ve heard about school programs that teach kids to say no to drugs and alcohol. In many cases drug and alcohol use go up after these programs because they pique the curiosity of the adolescent students. The only thing that has been shown to work consistently is raising taxes on these products and placing limits on where and when they can be sold. When these measures are taken, use goes down.4

As barriers to the use of tobacco have gone up, barriers to pornography have gone down. In the past, getting sexually explicit pictures was something of an ordeal. People had to muster the courage to walk into a drugstore, pick up a magazine, and then hope the cashier wasn’t a member of the opposite sex. Today, pornographic pictures and videos can be had in seconds and in complete privacy. There are no barriers of embarrassment or shame.

We don’t yet know if compulsive viewing of pornography is exactly the same as drug addiction, but they have things in common. As with drug addiction, people who become trapped in a cycle of excessive pornography use spend more and more time pursuing this activity—sometimes many

hours every day. They abandon other activities so they can focus on adult internet sites. Sexual relations with their partners tend to become less frequent and less satisfying. One young man gave up dating completely. He said that he’d rather look at pornography than go out with a real woman because the women in the pictures never demanded anything of him, and never said no.

As with drugs, habituation can also occur with pornography, in which the starting “dose” no longer works as well. When sex addicts were repeatedly shown the same sexual images, their interest diminished. The activity measured in their dopamine circuits also decreased as the images were shown over and over. The same thing happened to healthy males who were repeatedly shown the same pornographic video. When they were shown a new video, their dopamine systems revved up again. This experience of a dopamine rush, followed by a dopamine drop (repeated images), followed by another dopamine rush (new images), pushes addicts to continually seek out fresh material, which may explain why browsing internet sex sites can become compulsive. It’s hard to resist the demands of dopamine circuits, especially with something as evolutionarily important as sex. The researchers who performed the study also identified a wanting/liking divide similar to what is seen in drug addiction: “Sex addicts showed higher levels of desire when watching pornography, but did not necessarily rate the explicit videos higher in their ‘liking’ scores.”

ARE VIDEO GAMES ADDICTIVE, TOO?

It’s not just pornography that can ensnare computer users. Some scientists claim that video games can also be addicting. In certain ways, video games are similar to casino games. Like slot machines, video games surprise players with unpredictable rewards. They do more than that, though, which can make them even more potent agents of dopamine release. In researching this problem, psychologist Douglas Gentile of Iowa State University found that nearly one in ten gamers ages eight to eighteen are addicted, causing family, social, school, or psychological damage because of their video game playing habits—a rate of addiction more than five times higher than that among gamblers, according to the National Research Council on

Pathological Gambling. What accounts for this large difference in how many users get addicted?

Part of the difference is that the video gamers Gentile studied were adolescents. It’s unusual for adults to experience serious negative consequences from playing video games. Adolescent brains, however, have not yet fully developed, so adolescents may act like adults with brain damage. The biggest difference in the adolescent brain is in the frontal lobes, which don’t completely develop until their early twenties. That’s a problem because it’s the frontal lobes that give adults good judgment. They act like a brake, warning us when we’re about to do something that might not be such a good idea. Without fully functioning frontal lobes, adolescents act impulsively, and are at greater risk of making unwise decisions, even when they know better.

There’s more to it than that, though. Video games are more complex than slot machines, so there are more opportunities for programmers to bake in features that trigger dopamine release in order to make it hard to stop playing.

Video games are all about imagination. They immerse us in a world where our fantasies can come true, where reality-shunning dopamine can bask in endless possibilities. We can explore environments that constantly change, ensuring that the surprises never end. We may start off in the desert, progress to a rain forest, then a dark alley in a gritty urban hell, then suddenly we’re on a rocket, hurtling toward an alien world.

Players do more than just explore, though. Video games are about progress. They’re about making the future better than the present. Gamers progress through levels while increasing their strength and abilities. It’s a dopamine dream come true. To keep progress front and center in a gamer’s mind, the screen constantly displays the accumulating points or growing progress bars so players never forget. They have to keep pursuing more.

Video games are full of rewards. Gamers collect coins, hunt for treasure, or maybe capture magic unicorns to progress to the next level. Players’ expectations are constantly kept off balance because they never know where the next reward will be. Some games make you kill monsters to earn points; others make you look inside treasure chests.

When a player opens a newly discovered chest, it may contain what he’s looking for, but not always. If you needed to collect, say, seven gems, and every chest you opened contained a gem, it would be completely

predictable. There would be no surprises, no reward prediction errors, no dopamine. If, on the other hand, you had to open a thousand chests to find a single gem, it would be so frustrating that everyone would give up. How does a game developer decide what percentage of chests should contain a gem? The answer is data. Lots of data.

Online games are constantly collecting information about players. How long do they play? When do they quit? What kinds of experiences make them play longer? What kinds make them give up? According to gaming theorist Tom Chatfield, the biggest online games have accumulated billions of data points about their players. They know exactly what lights up dopamine, and what turns it off—though game designers are not thinking of these events as dopamine triggers, but simply as “what works.”

So, what do the data tell us about the ideal portion of treasure chests that should contain gems? It turns out that 25 percent is the magic number. That’s what keeps people playing the longest. And there’s no reason why the other 75 percent should be empty. Game developers put low-value rewards in the non-gem chests so every single one will contain a surprise. Maybe it’s a small coin. Maybe it’s a new scope for your rifle. Maybe it’s a pair of sunglasses that will make your online character look cool. Or maybe it’s something so powerful that it opens up completely new ways to interact with the game. Chatfield tells us that a reward like that should be found in only one out of a thousand treasure chests. (By the way, the game probably won’t let you progress to the next level with only those seven gems. The billions of data points tell us that fifteen is the optimal number for getting people to play as long as possible.)

It’s worth mentioning that there are also H&N pleasures in video games that contribute to their appeal. Many games let you play with friends. The pleasure we get when we socialize for no other reason than the enjoyment of the company of others is an H&N experience. On the other hand, when we get together to accomplish a shared goal, it’s dopaminergic because we’re working toward a better future (even if it’s just capturing the enemy’s base). Video games provide both types of social pleasure.

Many video games are also beautiful, another way of stimulating H&N delight. Some of them are, in fact, astonishing because enormous resources have been poured into amassing talented people to create them. The Los Angeles Times reported that developing the online game Star Wars: The Old Republic required more than eight hundred people on four continents at a

cost of over $200 million. The world of the game is vast. Working through all the story lines would require 1,600 hours of play. Spending that much money to create a game is risky, but there’s the potential for a big payoff. Grand Theft Auto, one of the most successful video game series, had sales of $1 billion in just three days for its fifth-generation release. Americans spend more than $20 billion per year on video games; they spent only half that much on movie tickets in 2016, the biggest U.S. box office year in history.

DOPAMINE VERSUS DOPAMINE

It’s natural to confuse wanting and liking. It seems obvious that we would want the things that we will like having. That’s how it would work if we were rational creatures, and despite all evidence to the contrary, we persist in thinking that we are rational creatures. But we’re not. Frequently we want things that we don’t like. Our desires can lead us toward things that may destroy our lives, such as drugs, gambling, and other out-of-control behaviors.

The dopamine desire circuit is powerful. It focuses attention, motivates, and thrills. It has a profound influence over the choices we make. Yet it isn’t all-powerful. Addicts get clean. Dieters lose weight. Sometimes we switch off the TV, get off the couch, and go for a run. What kind of circuit in the brain is powerful enough to oppose dopamine? Dopamine is. Dopamine opposing dopamine. The circuit that opposes the desire circuit might be called the dopamine control circuit.

You may recall that in many situations, future-focused dopamine opposes the activity of the H&N circuits and vice versa. If you’re thinking about where to go for dinner, you’re probably not appreciating the taste, smell, and texture of the sandwich you’re eating for lunch. But there’s also opposition within the future-oriented dopamine system itself.

Why would the brain develop circuits that work against each other? Wouldn’t it make more sense to have everyone pulling together, so to speak? In fact, no. Systems that contain opposing forces are easier to control. That’s why cars have both an accelerator and a brake, and why the brain uses circuits that counter each other.

Not surprisingly, the dopamine control circuit involves the frontal lobes, the part of the brain that is sometimes called the neocortex because it evolved most recently. It’s what makes human beings unique. It gives us the imagination to project ourselves further into the future than the desire circuit can take us, so we can make long-term plans. It’s also the part that allows us to maximize resources in that future by creating new tools and using abstract concepts; concepts that rise above the here-and-now experience of the senses, like language, mathematics, and science. It’s intensely rational. It doesn’t feel, because emotion is an H&N phenomenon. As we will see in the next chapter, it’s cold, calculating, and ruthless, doing whatever it takes to reach its goal.

1 When scientists injected long-time cocaine users with a stimulant similar to cocaine, they

released 80 percent less dopamine than healthy people given the same drug. The dopamine released by the addicts was about the same amount that the scientists saw when they injected a placebo—an inactive substance, such as salt water. 2 To protect privacy, we have disguised or created composites of individuals and their cases

throughout the book. 3 This problem primarily affects men, but women are not immune. In the Mayo Clinic series of

thirteen patients, two were female, both single and sexually abstinent prior to starting treatment. 4 Raising the price of cigarettes and alcohol is controversial, though, especially with regard to

cigarettes. Fewer and fewer people smoke. Those who persist tend to be poor and less educated. As a result, increases in cigarette taxes hit them the hardest. This is the opposite of a tax system that shifts more of the burden onto those who are better able to afford it. Advocates who defend this strategy argue that the pain caused by raising taxes on the poor is counterbalanced by reducing their risk of getting cancer, emphysema, and heart disease.
