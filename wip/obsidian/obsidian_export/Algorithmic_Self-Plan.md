# Algorithmic Self-Plan

## Ontological Definition
An **Algorithmic Self-Plan** is an artificial Disposition intentionally constructed and inscribed into the [[Human Cognitive Agent]]. Unlike natural dispositions (like the fear response), this is a "software" patch created by the agent itself.

It takes the form of a conditional rule ("If Situation X occurs, then I will do Action Y"). Once established, it functions as an automated mechanism, bypassing the need for conscious [[Attentional Focus]] or willpower at the moment of action. It is a "sleeping" decision waiting for a specific environmental cue to wake it.

## Relational Calculus
- **inheresIn:** [[Human Cognitive Agent]]
- **createdBy:** [[Intention]] *(The conscious act that installed the plan)*
- **triggeredBy:** [[Anticipated Cue]]
