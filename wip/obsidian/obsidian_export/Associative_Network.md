# Associative Network

## Ontological Definition
The **Associative Network** is a complex Disposition (or potentiality) inhering in the [[Human Cognitive Agent]]. It constitutes the "physics" of thought, defined by the latent probability that activating Concept X will bio-chemically ready and activate Concept Y.

This Disposition is the structural foundation of "Pre-Suasion." It remains silent until triggered by a [[Pre-Suasive Opener]]. For example, the network contains the latent connection between "Clouds" and "Softness." The connection exists as a potential structure even when the agent is not thinking about clouds; it is a mechanism waiting to be fired.

## Relational Calculus
- **inheresIn:** [[Human Cognitive Agent]]
- **triggeredBy:** [[Pre-Suasive Opener]]
- **manifestsAs:** [[Biased Weighting Quality]] *(The resulting shift in perception)*
