# Commitment: The Social Debt

## Ontological Definition
**The Social Debt** is a normative entity—an invisible rule that binds the Agent's future. It comes into existence the moment a gift (the "Cookie" or "Favor") is accepted.

Ontologically, a Commitment is a restriction on future Agency. It dictates that if the Agent wishes to remain a "valid social member," they *must* perform a specific Action (repayment). Pre-suasion often works by artificially generating these Commitments (through unexpected gifts) to force the Agent into a specific behavioral chute. It transforms a request into an obligation.
