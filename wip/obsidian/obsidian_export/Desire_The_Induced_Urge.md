# Desire: The Induced Urge

## Ontological Definition
**The Induced Urge** is a passive Intentional Moment with a "World-to-Mind" direction of fit. Crucially, in the context of Pre-Suasion, this is **not** authored by the Agent; it is *suffered* by the Agent.

It arises directly from the triggering of a biological Disposition (UFO-A). When a "Mystery" is presented, the Agent does not *choose* to be curious; the **Desire for Closure** invades their consciousness. When a "Sugar-Free Cookie" is accepted, the Agent does not *choose* to feel indebted; the **Desire to Reciprocate** manifests automatically. This primitive is the bridge between blind biology and conscious choice.
