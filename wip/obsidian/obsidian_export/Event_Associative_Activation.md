# Event: Associative Activation

## Ontological Definition
**Associative Activation** is the dynamic, biological process that unfolds when a [[Pre-Suasive Opener]] interacts with a cognitive agent. It is not a conscious thought; it is a mechanistic cascade.

Mechanistically, this **Event** is the rapid firing of neural pathways. When the specific stimulus (e.g., an image of a cloud) hits the retina, it manifests the latent disposition of the agent's neural structure. The activation spreads from the focal node ("Cloud") to adjacent nodes ("Softness," "Comfort"), physically altering the bio-chemical readiness of those concepts. Time transitions the agent from a state of neutrality to a state of biased weighting.

## Relational Calculus
- **manifests:** [[Associative Network]] *(The Event is the actual firing of this latent disposition.)*
- **bringsAbout:** [[Situation: The Privileged Moment]] *(The specific post-condition where certain concepts are now hyper-accessible.)*
