# Event: Systemic Ethical Decay

## Ontological Definition
**Systemic Ethical Decay** is the slow-motion, grinding **Event** that consumes an organization over time. It is the blind, causal consequence of the disposition [[Systemic Ethical Corrosion]].

When an organization institutes a policy of lying (the trigger), this process unfolds inevitably:
1.  Honest agents experience metabolic stress (burnout).
2.  Honest agents exit the system (turnover).
3.  Dishonest agents remain and multiply (selection bias).
This is not a "choice" but a filtration process, much like a chemical reaction sorting heavy elements from light ones.

## Relational Calculus
- **manifests:** [[Systemic Ethical Corrosion]] *(The unfolding of the latent self-destruct mechanism in dishonest systems.)*
- **bringsAbout:** [[Situation: The Hollowed Structure]] *(A state of high fraud, low competence, and reputational ruin.)*
