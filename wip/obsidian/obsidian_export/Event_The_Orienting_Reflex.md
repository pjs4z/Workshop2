# Event: The Orienting Reflex

## Ontological Definition
**The Orienting Reflex** is the "Pavlovian" disruption of the timeline. It is the blind, physiological **Event** that occurs when a high-salience stimulus (a loud noise, a sexual cue, a sudden movement) intrudes upon the environment.

This process is the manifestation of the agent's finite [[Attentional Focus]]. The event physically redirects the agent's sensory apparatus toward the stimulus, inhibiting all other inputs. It acts as a "cut" in the continuity of thought, severing previous focuses and forcefully assigning the quality of "Importance" to the new object. It is the mechanism that generates the *Focusing Illusion*.

## Relational Calculus
- **manifests:** [[Attentional Focus]] *(Specifically the dispositional vulnerability to have focus commandeered by novelty.)*
- **bringsAbout:** [[Situation: Focal Monomania]] *(A state where the focal object is perceived as the sole cause of events.)*
