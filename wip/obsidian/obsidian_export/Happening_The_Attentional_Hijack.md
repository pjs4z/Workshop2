# Happening: The Attentional Hijack

## Ontological Definition
**The Attentional Hijack** is an event that occurs *to* the Agent. It is an "un-authored" experience. When a loud noise occurs, or a sexually attractive stimulus appears, the Agent's focus snaps to it.

We classify this as a **Happening**, not an Action, because it lacks an Intention. The Agent did not *decide* to look; the mechanics of the *Orienting Response* forced the look. This is the moment where the Persuader exploits the Agent's biological machinery to insert a new variable into their consciousness.

## Relational Calculus
- **inheresIn:** [[The Target Agent]] *(The subject experiencing the hijack)*
- **manifests:** [[Attentional Focus]] *(The limited resource being commandeered)*
- **bringsAbout:** [[Desire: The Induced Urge]] *(The resulting craving or bias)*
