# Human Cognitive Agent

## Ontological Definition
The **Human Cognitive Agent** is the rigid, substantial Kind representing the individual subject of influence. Ontologically, this entity is the independent bearer of all psychological qualities and dispositions necessary for pre-suasion mechanics. It is the locus where attention is limited, where associations are stored, and where the "Self" is constructed.

Unlike a mere physical object, the Cognitive Agent is characterized by its capacity to bear Intentional Moments (beliefs, desires) and its susceptibility to *Associative Coherence*. It serves as the "Host" for the finite resource of Attention and the latent neural pathways that link concepts (e.g., linking "clouds" to "comfort").
