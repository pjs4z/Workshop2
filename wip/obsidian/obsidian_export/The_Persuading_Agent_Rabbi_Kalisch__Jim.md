# The Persuading Agent (Rabbi Kalisch / Jim)

## Ontological Definition
The **Persuading Agent** is a Substantial endowed with high-level Intentionality. Unlike the Target, whose agency is currently being constrained by associative reflex, the Persuader is operating with "Sovereign Agency."

This Agent possesses a meta-cognitive model of the Target's mind. They do not merely act; they *simulate* the causal chain of the Target's thoughts. Their agency is defined by the capacity to decouple from the immediate physical reality (e.g., the reality that "We are allies of Nazis") and construct a counter-factual social reality ("We are Asian, like you") to achieve a specific teleological goal.

## Relational Calculus
- **bearerOf:** [[Intention: The Strategic Frame]] *(The active commitment to alter the Target's perception)*
- **bearerOf:** [[Social Commitment: Fiduciary Duty]] *(In the case of Buffett, the internal rule to protect the shareholder)*
