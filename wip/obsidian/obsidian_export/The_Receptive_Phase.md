# The Receptive Phase

## Ontological Definition
The **Receptive Phase** (or "Privileged Moment") is a contingent, intrinsic state of the [[Human Cognitive Agent]]. It represents a temporary alteration in the agent's internal configuration where standard resistance mechanisms are suspended or bypassed.

This Phase is distinct from the agent's "Baseline Phase." During the Receptive Phase, the agent's decision-making weightings are biased toward a specific concept (e.g., helpfulness, safety, adventurousness) due to the lingering activation of an associative prime. It is a "window of opportunity" structured by the agent's altered attentional landscape.
