# Unity Relation

## Ontological Definition
**Unity** is a social Relator—an objective, binding entity that connects two or more [[Human Cognitive Agents]]. It acts as the truth-maker for the claim "We are one."

This Relator is not merely a feeling; it is a structural categorization constructed through specific conditions: **Co-Genealogy** (kinship), **Co-Location** (place), or **Synchronous Action** (co-movement). When this Relator exists between a Persuader and a Target, it fundamentally alters the rules of exchange, dissolving the barrier between "Self" and "Other" and creating a fused entity where self-interest becomes collective interest.

## Relational Calculus
- **mediates:** [[Role: In-Group Member (Self)]], [[Role: In-Group Member (Other)]]
- **groundedIn:** [[Synchronous Action]] *OR* [[Shared Geography]]
