# Cognitive Fixation

## Ontological Definition
A limiting disposition or bias inherent in the Control Dopamine system. It represents the tendency of the brain to rely on familiar neural pathways, known categories, and previous solutions ("The Titanic view of the iceberg").

Structurally, it acts as an inhibitor to Divergent Thinking. It is the rigidity that results when the calculating brain suppresses the raw novelty-seeking of the desire brain too early or too strictly.
