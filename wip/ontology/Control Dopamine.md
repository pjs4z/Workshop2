# Control Dopamine

## Ontological Definition
A sophisticated cognitive disposition rooted in the frontal lobes of the Human Neurocognitive System. Unlike the raw impulse of Desire Dopamine, this disposition represents the potential for abstract manipulation of the environment. It is the structural capacity for planning, strategizing, and dominating the extrapersonal space through calculation rather than mere craving.

This primitive enables "Mental Time Travel"—the ability to simulate future scenarios and weigh probabilities without physical action. It provides the architectural check against raw impulse, allowing for the synthesis of disparate ideas into practical solutions (Convergent Thinking), though it carries the vulnerability of trapping the agent in familiar patterns (Cognitive Fixation).
