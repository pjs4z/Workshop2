# Convergent Thinking

## Ontological Definition
A functional mode of the Control Dopamine circuit characterized by rigorous filtering, analysis, and synthesis. It is the structural state where abstract ideas gathered by divergent thinking are sorted into practical solutions.

This mode relies on the suppression of irrelevant data and the application of logic. While necessary for execution, an over-reliance on this mode without the precursor of Divergent Thinking results in sterility or the repetition of known patterns.
