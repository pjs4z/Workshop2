# Divergent Thinking

## Ontological Definition
A functional mode of the Desire Dopamine circuit characterized by the suspension of judgment and the widening of salience. In this state, the cognitive filter is dilated to accept low-probability associations, unrelated concepts, and raw novelty.

It is the structural basis for the "gathering" phase of creativity. It exists in opposition to Cognitive Fixation. Ontologically, it is an unregulated search process that prioritizes quantity and novelty over feasibility.
