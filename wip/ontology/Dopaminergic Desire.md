# Dopaminergic Desire

## Ontological Definition
A vital functional disposition inherent in the Human Neurocognitive System, characterized by the latent potential to identify novel value and generate visceral motivation. It acts as the "alarm system" of the brain, strictly oriented toward the future and the unknown. Its structural essence is defined by its ceaseless drive for *more*—it is ontologically incapable of processing satisfaction, only anticipation.

As a disposition, it remains dormant until triggered by a specific condition (often a Reward Prediction Error) or a cue associated with the extrapersonal space. It constitutes the raw, emotional urge that propels the agent toward things not currently possessed, manifesting structurally as the "itch" that precedes the scratch.
