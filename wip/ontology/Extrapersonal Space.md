# Extrapersonal Space

## Ontological Definition
A complex objective relation binding the Agent to objects, goals, or concepts that are physically out of reach. It acts as the truth-maker for the state of "Wanting." Unlike a physical container, this is a relational domain defined by distance, effort, and time—it is the realm of things that *can be* but *are not yet*.

This relator serves as the exclusive playground for the Dopaminergic Desire system. Any object falling within this relational scope triggers the "Molecule of More." Once an object traverses this boundary and is acquired, the relation dissolves, transforming into Peripersonal Space, causing the dopamine current to cease.
