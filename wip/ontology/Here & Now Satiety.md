# Here & Now Satiety

## Ontological Definition
The neurochemical disposition responsible for the experience of satisfaction, sensory enjoyment, and the appreciation of the present moment. Mediated by a collective of neurotransmitters (serotonin, oxytocin, endorphins, endocannabinoids), this primitive represents the structural capacity of the agent to "have" rather than "want."

It functions as the inhibitory counterbalance to Dopaminergic Desire. While dopamine governs the pursuit of the future, this disposition governs the consumption of the present (peripersonal space). Its activation is structurally mutually exclusive with high-intensity dopaminergic arousal, creating the fundamental tension of human dissatisfaction.
