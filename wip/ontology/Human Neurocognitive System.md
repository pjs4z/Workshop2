# Human Neurocognitive System

## Ontological Definition
The rigid, substantial universal representing the human agent as a biological and psychological unity. Within the scope of this domain, it serves as the ontological bearer (subject) for all neurochemical dispositions, qualities, and cognitive roles. It is the locus where the tension between "wanting" (dopamine) and "having" (Here & Now chemicals) plays out.

This entity acts as the substantial host for the dual-circuit architecture of motivation (Desire vs. Control) and is the physical substrate subject to the laws of neuroadaptation (upregulation and downregulation). It is the persistent entity that navigates between the peripersonal and extrapersonal spaces.
