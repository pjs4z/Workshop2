# Neuroadaptive Tolerance

## Ontological Definition
A measurable, continuous quality of the Human Neurocognitive System determining its sensitivity to stimulation. This quality fluctuates along a gradient defined by receptor density and responsiveness. It represents the biological baseline that dictates how much stimulation is required to achieve a hedonic effect.

This quality is subject to two directional shifts: "Downregulation" (a decrease in sensitivity caused by over-stimulation, leading to the "more to feel less" dynamic) and "Upregulation" (an increase in sensitivity achieved through abstinence). Structurally, this quality explains the phenomenon of the "Dopamine Cycle" and the transient nature of satisfaction.
