# Peripersonal Space

## Ontological Definition
The relational domain binding the Agent to objects within immediate sensory or physical reach (touching, tasting, holding). It is the ontological domain of "Having" and consumption. This relator validates the activation of Here & Now chemicals.

Objects existing within this relational sphere are structurally invisible to Dopaminergic Desire; they cannot be "wanted" in the dopaminergic sense because they are already possessed. This primitive explains why satisfaction (consumption) often leads to the death of motivation (anticipation).
