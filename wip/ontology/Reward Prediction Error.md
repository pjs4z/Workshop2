# Reward Prediction Error

## Ontological Definition
A relational disposition or mechanism that acts as the primary trigger for Dopaminergic Desire. It is defined not by the absolute value of a reward, but by the *delta* between expectation and reality. Structurally, it is a comparator mechanism: it possesses the potential to spike dopamine only when an outcome exceeds the predicted baseline ("a good surprise").

If the outcome equals the expectation, this disposition remains inert (no dopamine spike), explaining why familiar rewards fail to trigger motivation. It is the ontological engine of novelty-seeking, ensuring that the agent is perpetually driven toward the unexpected rather than the known.
