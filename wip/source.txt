# Human Cognitive Agent

## Ontological Definition
The **Human Cognitive Agent** is the rigid, substantial Kind representing the individual subject of influence. Ontologically, this entity is the independent bearer of all psychological qualities and dispositions necessary for pre-suasion mechanics. It is the locus where attention is limited, where associations are stored, and where the "Self" is constructed.

Unlike a mere physical object, the Cognitive Agent is characterized by its capacity to bear Intentional Moments (beliefs, desires) and its susceptibility to *Associative Coherence*. It serves as the "Host" for the finite resource of Attention and the latent neural pathways that link concepts (e.g., linking "clouds" to "comfort").

# Pre-Suasive Opener

## Ontological Definition
The **Pre-Suasive Opener** is an anti-rigid Role played by a Physical Object or Abstract Concept when it is positioned immediately preceding a core message. An entity (such as a generic picture of a cloud, a specific question, or a sugar-free cookie) enters this Role solely through its *relational context*—specifically, its temporal placement before a persuasive request.

In this Role, the entity ceases to be neutral background noise and becomes a functional tool for "frontloading" attention. Its structural purpose is to trigger specific latent dispositions within the [[Human Cognitive Agent]], thereby altering the agent's receptivity before the actual message is processed.

# The Receptive Phase

## Ontological Definition
The **Receptive Phase** (or "Privileged Moment") is a contingent, intrinsic state of the [[Human Cognitive Agent]]. It represents a temporary alteration in the agent's internal configuration where standard resistance mechanisms are suspended or bypassed.

This Phase is distinct from the agent's "Baseline Phase." During the Receptive Phase, the agent's decision-making weightings are biased toward a specific concept (e.g., helpfulness, safety, adventurousness) due to the lingering activation of an associative prime. It is a "window of opportunity" structured by the agent's altered attentional landscape.

# Attentional Focus

## Ontological Definition
**Attentional Focus** is a measurable, continuous Quality inhering in the [[Human Cognitive Agent]]. It represents the magnitude and direction of the agent's cognitive resources at any given instant.

Crucially, this Quality adheres to a "Zero-Sum" conservation law, often described as the "Single-Chute" limitation. If the value of Attentional Focus is high on Object A, it must structurally be near-zero for Object B. This exclusivity allows for the *Focusing Illusion*—the structural reality that whatever possesses the highest value of Attentional Focus is perceived by the Agent as having the highest causal importance.

# Associative Network

## Ontological Definition
The **Associative Network** is a complex Disposition (or potentiality) inhering in the [[Human Cognitive Agent]]. It constitutes the "physics" of thought, defined by the latent probability that activating Concept X will bio-chemically ready and activate Concept Y.

This Disposition is the structural foundation of "Pre-Suasion." It remains silent until triggered by a [[Pre-Suasive Opener]]. For example, the network contains the latent connection between "Clouds" and "Softness." The connection exists as a potential structure even when the agent is not thinking about clouds; it is a mechanism waiting to be fired.

# Zeigarnik Disposition

## Ontological Definition
The **Zeigarnik Disposition** is a specific cognitive vulnerability (Disposition) inhering in the [[Human Cognitive Agent]]. It is the latent mechanism that generates cognitive tension in the presence of incomplete information.

Structurally, this Disposition operates as a retention engine. When the environmental condition (Situation) involves an "Open Loop" or "Unfinished Task," this Disposition manifests by hoarding [[Attentional Focus]] and preventing cognitive disengagement. It is the structural guarantee that mystery magnets attention.

# Unity Relation

## Ontological Definition
**Unity** is a social Relator—an objective, binding entity that connects two or more [[Human Cognitive Agents]]. It acts as the truth-maker for the claim "We are one."

This Relator is not merely a feeling; it is a structural categorization constructed through specific conditions: **Co-Genealogy** (kinship), **Co-Location** (place), or **Synchronous Action** (co-movement). When this Relator exists between a Persuader and a Target, it fundamentally alters the rules of exchange, dissolving the barrier between "Self" and "Other" and creating a fused entity where self-interest becomes collective interest.

# Systemic Ethical Corrosion

## Ontological Definition
**Systemic Ethical Corrosion** (the "Triple Tumor Structure") is a complex, destructive Disposition inhering in a [[Social Organization]]. It represents the inevitable structural vulnerability of a group that mandates dishonesty.

It is defined by a specific causal necessity: if an organization possesses the internal rule "Deceive Outsiders," this Disposition is the latent mechanism that guarantees three internal manifestations: **Moral Stress** (degrading performance), **Moral Flight** (expulsion of honest agents), and **Malfeasance** (retention of dishonest agents). It is a "self-destruct" mechanism built into the ontology of deceitful systems.

# Algorithmic Self-Plan

## Ontological Definition
An **Algorithmic Self-Plan** is an artificial Disposition intentionally constructed and inscribed into the [[Human Cognitive Agent]]. Unlike natural dispositions (like the fear response), this is a "software" patch created by the agent itself.

It takes the form of a conditional rule ("If Situation X occurs, then I will do Action Y"). Once established, it functions as an automated mechanism, bypassing the need for conscious [[Attentional Focus]] or willpower at the moment of action. It is a "sleeping" decision waiting for a specific environmental cue to wake it.
