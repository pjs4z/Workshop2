# Taming Molecule of More

## Introduction: Let’s Find Some Answers, then Let’s Look for . . . More

The most important chemical in the human brain is dopamine.

That’s not to say that other neurotransmitters are trivial. In fact, they are vital. Serotonin is often central to depression and its treatment. Endorphin affects mood and helps mitigate pain. Oxytocin is essential to sex, attachment, and maternal behavior. Anxiety, eating disorders, dealing with trauma—to address them, we would need a sophisticated understanding of many brain chemicals at the same time.

But when it comes to the moment-to-moment experience of modern life, dopamine is where we begin. It is the key to understanding the urges we feel and why we respond the way we do. In most matters, if you want to improve your outlook and behavior, stroll past the other neurotransmitters and start here. It isn’t even close. Navigating a romantic relationship? Dopamine. Separating lust from caring? Dopamine. Seeing through the attraction of risky behavior? Dopamine. Taming the lure of online porn, infidelity, social media, doomscrolling, getting high, giving up, putting work over family, or pushing your most important responsibilities a little further down the list of things to do? Dopamine, dopamine, dopamine.

When it comes to navigating any choice in life, dopamine pushes us toward acquisition and discovery. That’s what it evolved to do because those are useful things—they keep us alive. But the nature of the world means that along that same path, we’ll also find damaging, even dangerous

options—troubling temptations and bad ideas with visceral appeal. At those points, dopamine can and will lead us astray. Here’s why: It’s telling us at every turn, How about you trade what you already have for the possibility of something even better?

It’s just ahead, says dopamine. Trust me.

Until the past few hundred years, the primary challenge humans faced was staying alive. Anything new and unknown could be dangerous—or useful, even lifesaving. With threats and opportunities around every corner, the dopamine system evolved to give us an instant, profound, and insistent urge to investigate anything unfamiliar and unexpected. In addition, dopamine evolved to match that urge with an on-the-fly capacity for planning, reasoning, and creative thinking when we need it most. Thus, not only are we fascinated by the unknown, we also leap to explore it. Dopamine’s one- two punch has led us forward as a species: it drives us to acquire an ever- growing understanding of the world around us, then to apply what we’ve learned to gain dominion over it all.

Fast-forward to the twenty-first century, where we stand astride the world as gods. Cell phones, televisions, microwave ovens, air travel, even indoor plumbing—we have mastered our home. The science fiction of even recent decades has failed to predict as spectacular a way of life as what we have achieved. A monarch in Shakespeare’s time would tremble at a tour of our tiniest grocery store. (If he or she got that far. The sovereign would’ve had a heart attack at the sight of the car we’d take to get there, never mind the sorcery of electric lights and paved roads.) Yet we never experience a day without at least one moment when we decide that this or that miracle is getting just a tad stale—spouse, job, car, apartment, TV, sneaker, waistline, bank account. Enter dopamine.

Surely I can do better, we think. I want . . . more. Thus the irony: Dopamine has enabled us to build a world that answers most of our needs, even our whims, and has rendered that world nearly devoid of immediate threat to the point that today we rarely need dopamine’s hair-trigger response and hardcore intensity. And since

evolution is slow, this leaves us with a new problem: much of what dopamine does is now not only unnecessary but also problematic. Once they had served their purpose, dopamine’s more forceful powers didn’t make a timely evolutionary exit. They stuck around. In the modern world, that means dopamine is frequently a villain.

Dopamine does most of its vital functioning outside of our awareness and stirs up trouble wherever our conscious mind is focused. We now catch dopamine asserting itself in situations where it has nothing constructive to contribute. It revs our anticipation, drives us to distraction over unlikely threats, and tempts us with dubious opportunities that borrow our peace and break our hearts. How odd that the biological system that equipped us to build this world full of miracles would now so frequently reduce us to twitchy, dissatisfied subjects of the domain it helped us create.

Seven hundred years ago, Chaucer wrote that familiarity breeds contempt, but he identified only half the problem. Familiarity also breeds boredom, and boredom is shorthand for the experience of lacking a challenge. That matters because humans are in constant need of at least a little pushback, and that’s why the biological imperative driven by dopamine will assert itself no matter how amazing, desirable, and safe our environment happens to be. This part of the brain has wired us for restlessness. As soon as our little corner of the world runs out of surprises to keep us amused, we get antsy. That’s when the molecule of more sends us spinning off in search of something new, a restless casting about for amusement often masquerading as genuine need.

This problem isn’t new. It’s built into the human condition. Adam and Eve had the entire Garden of Eden to enjoy and even they got restless. Once you cross the finish line and claim the prize you sought, it’s only a matter of time before you get bored with it.

Not that we’re helpless against this. Dopamine drives us toward more, but it’s up to us to decide whether to embrace that motivation, modulate it, or turn it down.

That’s hard. We need to tame dopamine when it pushes us toward the more we don’t need, and let it do its thing when it promises a more worth having. This skill does not come naturally. Building our capacity for it is the subject of this book.

We’ll need something else too. We’ll need something to make us remember at every turn that this problem is more than biology and chemistry.

Against the push of dopamine-driven demands, we will need to find an outlook to give us a meaningful way to navigate life. That’s a tough one, and it has troubled humans since we first appeared on the earth. We have to figure out how to live a life that gives us not only peace for today but also optimism for tomorrow, and we’ll have to do it in a world that seems inclined against both. It’s a tall order made more demanding by the fact that the solution will not come falling from the sky. We have to find it.

In the film Crimes and Misdemeanors, here’s how a character played by psychoanalyst Martin Bergmann memorably described the problem:

We define ourselves by the choices we have made. We are in fact the sum total of our choices. Events unfold so unpredictably, so unfairly, human happiness does not seem to have been included in the design of creation. It is only we, with our capacity to love, that give meaning to the indifferent universe. And yet most human beings seem to have the ability to keep trying, and even to find joy from simple things like their family, their work, and from the hope that future generations might understand more.1

Human happiness does not seem to have been included in the design of creation.

Despite the swarming anticipation that dopamine stirs, no permanent satisfaction is automatically coming soon, no sense of completeness is for- sure bound up in events just ahead, and no fulfillment is guaranteed to be extracted from chasing the river of maybe/maybe-not promises that modern life squeezes out of dopamine.

It is only we, with our capacity to love, who give meaning to the indifferent universe.

And there it is. Not only is the day-to-day challenge of dopamine ours to address but so is the deeper need for meaning.

By dint of human nature, we are bound to try to calm the bitchy back- and-forth inside us that lurches between anticipation and disappointment. This struggle appears to be an unavoidable byproduct of the design of the brain—the wonderful, miserable motor that drives our pursuit of progress. To feel better in the face of the day-to-day challenge of dopamine, we need coping mechanisms that reflect the facts of neuroscience. But to find meaning, we must craft a narrative to attach us to purpose across a lifetime.

I submit that the daily struggles and the need for meaning are bound up together. The solution is for us to do what evolution has not: find the deus ex machina or put one there ourselves—and not just any deus will do. We must find a meaning—or, more precisely, a pursuit of meaning—that helps us really cope simultaneously with the daily, even hourly, struggles that come to us from dopamine.

Let’s begin here. The secret of life, as James Taylor sang, is enjoying the passage of time. Or as a wise young man once put it, “Life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.”2

We must decide to quit chasing the promise of tomorrow as if the pleasure we can take from today is a lesser concern. We must choose to take joy not just from pursuing what might be but also from appreciating what is. In this book, we’ll collect ways to tame the bit of biology that links serial progress with nagging dissatisfaction, but we won’t stop there. Our struggles and our triumphs ought to add up to something greater. A life that feels well lived requires us to balance the burden of wanting versus having.

It’s ironic. We are overwhelmed by the urge to pursue every potential acquisition that appears before us. But to find relief from that, you and I are obligated to search for something . . . more.

This book begins, in part I, with an explanation of what dopamine does and how it works. A tour of this neurotransmitter and its brain systems will give you an understanding of the science behind much of the day-to-day human experience. Later in the book, when we discuss ways to help you

deal with your dopamine-related challenges, this information will help you identify and more effectively apply the approaches we’ll explore.

Part II describes things you can use to drive more or less dopamine activity overall. You’ll find approaches to raise or lower the overall impact of dopamine on mood, urges, and behavior. There are compounds, treatments, and activities available right now that can make a difference in your day. We’ll also explore other prospects now being investigated.

Part III provides support, one issue at a time, for specific dopamine-related problems. Here we explore step-by-step techniques to more effectively manage particular challenges driven by the molecule of more. These approaches will help you gain greater control over the feelings and choices that trouble you the most.

“Finale” describes the most critical element in dealing with dopamine. Having addressed particular dopamine-related problems and their solutions, we now have another opportunity: to find a way to deal with the foundational feelings that make those problems occur so frequently and so intensely in our lives. For this we will fuse the discipline of neuroscience with something just as significant from the realm of ideas. I’ll propose a modern twist on an ancient way of navigating daily life so we might make for ourselves a more satisfying, more complete life.

What you find here is going to surprise you—in a good way. You can feel better. It starts with your decision to make the effort—and it’s worth it. Read on.

WHAT CAN I DO RIGHT NOW?

The point of the first book, The Molecule of More, was to show you the surprising and profound influence of dopamine in life and culture. The point of this book is to equip you with skills to help you change that influence for the better in your daily life. The recommendations you’ll find come from research into published, peer-reviewed medical and psychological studies. In some cases I spoke extensively with psychiatrist Dan Lieberman, my co-author on our original book, whose career-long specialty has been providing people with practical ways to help them feel better.

At this point, you may not be able to clearly identify which of your issues are related to dopamine, but would like to start making progress anyway, right away. Here are five simple things you can start doing now to improve the best effects of dopamine and reduce those that may be causing you trouble. Doing these things will raise your confidence and lower your anxiety—and give you a head start on taming the molecule of more.

Get regular physical activity. One well-proven way to increase constructive dopamine activity is to get some exercise. Beyond potentially boosting dopamine, regular physical activity also reinforces the exercise habit (via the dopamine reward system, which we will discuss in part I). The improvements that come with consistent exercise are likely to give you an improved mood, superior self-control, and a stronger sense of your own worth.

Prioritize sleep. Simply getting enough sleep, and getting it regularly, has far-reaching effects on the dopamine system. Sleep deprivation appears to decrease the positive effects of dopamine by reducing the availability of the receptors that allow it to function—think of having lots of cars in a city and not enough roads to drive them on.3 Good sleep habits help fix that. In addition, the dopamine system is tied to our circadian rhythms, the twenty-four-hour cycles of the body and brain. Disrupting one system can disrupt the other. Thus, good sleep provides bank-shot support for dopamine function, which in turn influences circadian rhythms related to vision, the sense of smell, certain types of motor function and reward systems, and general equilibrium among bodily systems.4

Put on some tunes. When you listen to music that you enjoy—and enjoyment appears to be key to the effect—several dopamine-oriented reward pathways in the brain are activated (including, for reasons not yet clear, pathways associated with survival). In addition, complex music with frequent variations in style, elements, and volume tends to create more neural activity than simpler music.5 Thus we have an easy way to stimulate the good feelings associated with dopamine: put on some tunes that really speak to you, songs that you love.*

Practice being still. Particular kinds of self-focus can stimulate dopamine. Consider yoga nidra, which is kind of meditation, but kind of not. Yoga nidra is best understood as the state between being awake and being asleep, a form of deep concentration and awareness that you can bring on yourself. It isn’t necessary to engage with the spiritual and philosophical aspects of yoga to make use of the practice, either. You can do it for its effects alone. But you’ll probably need help. An internet search will lead you most often to lists of vague instructions like “visualize your goal” and “find a safe place in your mind”—not much help, that. Instead, try “guided meditation”: find someone, either in person or on YouTube, who has done yoga nidra successfully and is experienced in talking others through achieving the state.

At least two studies indicate that yoga nidra (and yoga generally) increases our dopamine activity. Such a boost is usually associated with more engagement with the world around us, but the increase associated with yoga nidra seems to cause less engagement and activity, and that’s a good thing. This decline gives us some relief from the demands of executive function, the part of the mind that helps us plan, focus, remember, and multitask.6 Other benefits that yoga nidra provides include increases in serotonin, which helps govern mood, and in brain- derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which plays a role in several areas including long-term memory.

Eat right. Good nutrition keeps the body in balance and helps every system to function properly. That includes the dopamine system. A healthy diet will support your body’s ability to produce dopamine; a less- than-healthy diet will undermine that ability. It’s as simple as that.

Don’t fall for dubious promises about “dopamine-enhancing” foods. Boosting your dopamine by eating or drinking some “miracle” food is about as likely as winning a Michelin star by tossing a little saffron into your boiled chicken. Unless you’re severely malnourished, your dopamine problem is not due to a lack of foods containing the chemical components of dopamine. Lean meats, dairy products, and leafy vegetables can be good for you but they won’t cause your body to produce extra dopamine any more than having flour, butter, and sugar in the pantry automatically leads to cookies in the cookie jar. The closest

we have to dopamine-related foods are fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, which stabilize blood glucose levels. High glucose levels can unnecessarily stimulate the brain’s reward systems, but consistent levels can help us avoid difficult bursts of urges, and for now, when it comes to dopamine and eating, that’s about it.

* Why do we like music in the first place? Part of it may come from surprise. Early in life, we learn how musical scales sound, and we recognize tension and release when the musician moves between chords. Music we like plays on these expectations. Since dopamine gives us a good feeling when we are surprised in a positive way, perhaps part of the attraction is that music often meets our ingrained expectations and then exceeds them through a surprising and enjoyable change of chord, key, or melody.

## Part I: Understanding the Molecule of More

### To Begin: An Ancient System Straining Against a Modern World

This book is a step-by-step, topic-by-topic guide on how to tame the effects of dopamine—to enhance its impact when we lack motivation, to decrease it when we’re overwhelmed, and to modulate it when we face a more nuanced challenge. Follow these techniques and you’ll have powerful tools to improve your life. But before we try to change anything about your relationship to dopamine, let’s start with a refresher on its basics.

Dopamine plays a crucial role in many of our conscious actions and reactions, particularly those involving motivation, reward, and choice. The feelings we have and the actions we take most often begin like this: See that thing you don’t have? That thing that’s new to you? It’s filled with possibilities and you should check it out. You want it. You may even need it. And if you make it yours, you’ll almost surely be safer, more satisfied, more secure—maybe all those things. Don’t doubt the feeling. Get busy!

The problem is this makes us more susceptible to impulse and less inclined toward careful decision-making. We’re driven more by allure than evidence, focusing on potential rather than reality. In the world of early humankind, where survival required minute-to-minute awareness, this constant sensitivity to potential risk and reward was ideal. But in a miraculous modern world filled with fantastic distractions? Such a system pulls us in a thousand directions, many of them destructive. Some

attractions have genuine value, but the rest range from harmless diversions to deadly disruptions. What we want is frequently in conflict with what we need. The most common result of this conflict—probably what brought you to this book and its predecessor—is that this parade of attractions, some dubious and some desirable, often leaves us with ennui, dissatisfaction, and the sense that this constant desire for more is leaving us with less.

Though the provocations the dopamine system encounters today are vastly different from those that early humans faced, its response is still the same, and therein lies the problem: the dopamine system evolved for a life humans no longer live. It is up to us to adapt our responses. To do that we’ll need a modern understanding of the ancient dopamine system. In this section, we’ll review how it works, its two key parts, how we experience them, and the benefits and challenges this system provides.

### Happiness Versus Survival

THE PROBLEM: CHOOSE HAPPINESS NOW . . . OR

BETTER THINGS LATER

What it takes to survive in the long run is rarely what makes us happy right now.

If I go to work, I can pay the rent . . . but I’d rather sleep in. This steamed broccoli will be good for me . . . but, c’mon! This place has ice cream!

I ought to save some of my paycheck for a rainy day . . . but I could buy this new TV right now.

Most of our moment-to-moment problems are like that: Do I want long- term reward or short-term fun? The things that enable our survival over time are rarely the things that make us happy right now, so we compromise. As individuals, we stick to a diet but give ourselves a cheat day. As a society, we agree to work Monday through Friday but take the weekend off. This sometimes casual, sometimes grave struggle between now and later— between discipline and delight—is a central feature of human experience. Sometimes there seems to be no middle ground at all: you can have a short, happy life or a long one built on self-denial.

But if you’re willing to dig, there’s some good news in all this: while unhappiness is built into the human brain, being unhappy has value. It’s one of the greatest motivators there is. It doesn’t take much to push us to act. For most people, all it takes is the tiniest sense that there is something better

ahead, something more to be had, just beyond where we are right now. This is how we make progress in life. We are often willing to sacrifice a little of our comfort in the moment for the possibility—not the certainty, just the tiniest sliver of “maybe” (and that’s going to be important)—that we can swap it for something better, something more.

Each decision we make is a tradeoff between today’s happiness and tomorrow’s “what if,” and the sacrifice of one or the other is entirely up to us. In matters great and small, this determines how we feel and what we achieve. It is the engine of progress.

THE BOTTOM LINE

We must regularly choose between gratification today and value tomorrow. This often leaves us unhappy, but there’s worth in that: being dissatisfied motivates us to create better things as individuals, families, organizations, and societies. Happy people don’t improve themselves or the world. That might not sound like good news, but it’s a powerful truth we can use.

THE SOURCE OF DESPAIR

The natural conflict between benefit tomorrow and pleasure today can leave us not just unhappy but in despair. As satisfaction from our victories fades, life often brings us back to the blues.

You got the job you wanted but in a while you feel disappointed because it wasn’t what you hoped. So you start looking for the next job, and the cycle begins again.

That designer dress you bought looked great in the dressing room but after a party or two it no longer seems so special. You put it on Poshmark and keep an eye out for the next one.

If only he’d go out with me. If only she’d sleep with me. If only this one would marry me.

Not long after we succeed, a nagging question always returns: Is that all there is?

After enough times on that merry-go-round, many of us start looking for something beyond the chase for possessions and achievements, something to give our lives more significance. One approach is to put work over everything else—but then family usually suffers, and we often find our career isn’t as fulfilling as we’d hoped. Or we try the opposite approach, putting family above work, but our financial security often suffers, or we miss the ambitious feelings from working so hard, or the kids grow up and move away and we end up alone with the spouse and the dog and now what? Other times we start living for hobbies, or social media, or travel, or volunteering, or education, or politics, or church, or gardening, or assuming the role of resident asshole at the homeowner’s association, and those don’t work, either. It really can feel like we’re back on that merry-go-round—one in the most pointless amusement park in the world. We find ourselves traveling the same sad circle again and again, marked at best by disappointment, and at worst by depression, anxiety, troubling behavior toward others, troubling behavior toward ourselves, or some combination of those things.

THE BOTTOM LINE

We desire something, we chase it, and finally we possess it. That’s how we get ahead in life. But achievement gives us only fleeting pleasure. Thus what pushes us toward progress can also drive us to despair. In this way a basic problem of human existence comes into focus: success and dissatisfaction are linked, perhaps inextricably.

AN ANCIENT SOLUTION OUT OF PLACE IN A MODERN

WORLD

Early humans lived in a world of hair-trigger threats and scarcity. They needed to be naturally attuned to every unfamiliar change around them because anything new might hurt them, be their next meal, or prove useful in some as-yet unimagined way. Thus our behavior, via brain systems, evolved to ensure our survival.

But the world has changed. If life still consisted primarily of bodily threats and meals you need to hunt down the same day you consume them, this constant attraction to more would be ideal, but that environment is long gone. The twenty-first-century world is a pretty safe place. We don’t have to engage with every prospective opportunity because, by and large, we are going to be okay. Thus, what was an evolutionary advantage is now in many ways a burden, one unique to modernity. Our survival no longer depends on a rabid urge to check out every minor mystery that crosses our path.

Yet we remain powerfully, biologically intrigued by every provocation and every possibility, so much so that the drawbacks of this hair-trigger system often interfere with normal life. If your next meal is not a worry, and you have a roof over your head and a coat in your closet, the urge to explore whatever is new is an urge too frequent and intense to serve you well. In the modern world, we end up chasing a lot of things we don’t need—and suffering the fallout.

THE BOTTOM LINE

We evolved a drive to be curious about new things because they might help us survive. That was useful for early humans, but in the modern world it leaves us susceptible to unnecessary, sometimes challenging or even dangerous, distraction. This ancient approach is too sweeping for how we live now. In a world as safe and secure as ours, frequent, superfluous curiosity comes with a cost.

THE NEUROTRANSMITTER BEHIND IT ALL:

DOPAMINE

The part of the brain responsible for all this is powered by a neurotransmitter (or brain chemical) known as dopamine. Dopamine and its associated circuits identify the possibility of something useful, then create a tantalizing feeling of anticipation and optimism that drives us to investigate. But note the illogic: the feeling is powered not by evidence but by the

unexplored potential for value. Thus we’re undertaking a lot of effort on untested optimism. Dopamine urges us forward not on the basis of Let’s weigh the pros and cons, but You bet it’s good! Let’s go get it!

In other words, dopamine urges us to race after what might be good on the false promise that it is.

That’s how dopamine can lead us to sacrifice the good things we already have for things that only might be good. It points beyond the horizon, where no one can see. Dopamine creates the itch that demands a scratch and drives us to take a chance, sometimes beyond our better judgment or good sense. Never for a sure thing and sometimes at a high cost, dopamine propels us forward to maybe, maybe make our lives better— more secure, more prosperous, more interesting, more everything. Dr. Dan Lieberman and I dubbed it “the molecule of more” for good reason. No matter how wonderful the thing we already have is, dopamine makes us dissatisfied with it and hungry for the next thing, no matter how uncertain it might be. This is why dopamine is so important to understand and tame.

Rainn Wilson, who played Dwight Schrute on the iconic series The Office, is famous, wealthy, and beloved by millions, yet he says that at the height of his success he felt miserable. He had a nagging feeling that, even with all he had, he ought to have more. Here’s how he put it in a conversation with comedian Bill Maher (emphasis added):

When I was in The Office, I spent several years really mostly unhappy because it wasn’t enough. I’m realizing now, like, I’m on a hit show, Emmy nominated every year, making lots of money . . . People love it. I wasn’t enjoying it. I was thinking about, “Why am I not a movie star? Why am I not the next Jack Black or the next Will Ferrell? How come I can’t have a movie career? [. . .] It was never enough.”7

It’s a classic dopamine experience. Whatever satisfying things we already possess, dopamine points beyond the here and now to say, This thing you don’t yet have? This is the real key to happiness. Go get it!

Dopamine doesn’t “know” anything certain about the promise it’s making. Think of a guy standing in front of a nightclub trying to draw people into the comedy show just inside. He promises you the funniest

night of your life, yet that guy has nothing to do with the show. He might not have even seen it! He’s a salesman with a single job: to get people in the door. Will you really enjoy the show? He’s gonna tell you that you will, but he doesn’t know for sure.

That salesman is dopamine. Dopamine is promising you a good time because that’s what dopamine does. It’s out there writing checks it’ll never have to cash. Making good on those promises is somebody else’s department.

THE BOTTOM LINE

Dopamine drives us to pursue whatever is new and potentially useful. The problem? It’s triggered by possibility, not certainty—optimism, not evidence. This causes us to chase things that often have no value at all or that may even break our hearts.

DOPAMINE’S PARTNER: THE HERE AND NOW

CHEMICALS

It’s important to understand that dopamine is half of a key partnership in our consciousness. Dopamine is the “wanting” brain chemical. It deals with things beyond our immediate control—the extrapersonal space—and does so via anticipation and planning.

Dopamine’s complement is literally all the other neurotransmitters. We’ll call them the “here & now” or “H&N” chemicals because they deal with things in the peripersonal space—the area that contains things within our physical grasp right now. As opposed to the anticipatory pleasures of dopamine, the H&N chemicals give us the enjoyment of seeing, hearing, tasting, touching, and smelling, which are consummatory pleasures.

The next time you buy something you’ve been saving up for and anticipating, pay attention to your feelings as the transaction is completed. This is the moment when the dopamine side of the partnership hands off to the H&N side, when the feeling of wanting gives way to the experience of having. You will be able to feel the switchover. Future-oriented dopamine

pulls back. Sensory-oriented H&N chemicals take over. Now that you possess the thing you sought, your feelings are determined by what it feels like to touch it, to see it, to hold it, to experience it. Your anticipation of what might be is replaced by the reality of what is. The pursuit is over, and the dopaminergic attraction that brought you to this point begins to pass. Its motivational purpose has been carried out. The feeling goes away. The only thing before you is reality—what you have in your possession.

This change in feelings—this departure from the realm of dopamine into the realm of the here and now—is, often, the beginning of an eventual letdown. It’s also the beginning of understanding why we so often grow bored with whatever we already have.

THE BOTTOM LINE

Dopamine gives us the ability to deal with things that are distant in time and space—things that we have to work and plan for if we are to secure them. The complement of dopamine is the set of brain chemicals that deal with the present and the close-in—the here & now chemicals. These are associated with the experience of consuming and doing. Dopamine is all about wanting. The H&N chemicals are all about having.

AN ALARM SYSTEM PLUS A CALCULATION SYSTEM

The dopamine system is made up of two subsystems. One we can think of as an alarm system. The other is a processing tool for figuring out what to do about whatever set off the first subsystem.*

Consider the first system. When we feel the urge to pursue some new and mysterious opportunity, that’s a mental alarm going off. This is the desire dopamine system in action. When we are weighing a decision to do something presented to us by that system, planning how to do it, gaming out possibilities, and imagining scenarios, we are using the second system, the control dopamine system. Control and desire operate as partners focused on the future, lashing together feeling (desire) and thinking (control). The former makes us want to move ahead. The latter gives us the ability to do

so. We start with the raw material of an unrefined urge, then process it with sophisticated and sustained calculation.

To reach our goals we need both, but it is desire dopamine† that keeps us on the path. Desire dopamine “promises” that we’ll experience a profoundly good feeling when we reach the goal and delivers that motivation all along the way.

The desire circuit begins deep within the brain in the ventral tegmental area, where a great deal of dopamine is produced. It ends in the nucleus accumbens, which influences mood and behavior via the limbic system. When the desire circuit is activated, we experience wanting for things we don’t have, plus related feelings such as motivation, enthusiasm, and anticipation.

The desire circuit also gives us a tantalizing feeling about what we’re chasing. It’s an intense experience that’s difficult to describe. Think of it as the pleasurable feeling of possessing something . . . before you actually possess it. This in-between bit of emotional business is often superior to the experience of securing what you desire. Consider that moment in a restaurant when a server puts a spectacular meal in front of you. The meal is yours, but you haven’t yet tasted it. This sensation combines the pleasure of anticipation and possession without being either one. Anticipation is mostly in the past, and possession is mostly in the future. They’re both good feelings but they’re definitely different. Which is better? Let’s ask Winnie- the-Pooh:

“Well,” said Pooh, “what I like best—” and then he had to stop and think. Because although Eating Honey was a very good thing to do, there was a moment just before you began to eat it which was better than when you were, but he didn’t know what it was called.8

In that moment “just before,” desire dopamine is doing what it does best: motivating us with a tantalizing promise of a great here-and-now pleasure in the future. By giving us a taste—a version—of what might be possible, the future-focused desire circuit motivates us to overcome obstacles between ourselves and the goal.

This is the exact moment that dopamine can lead us into trouble. All that matters to the desire dopamine system is that a thing is new and novel. It “wants” that thing without considering whether it is healthy, wise, or responsible—there’s no reason yet imposed, no rational deliberation. If the desire circuit was all we had—or if it was out of tune with the rest of the brain, or damaged—we’d chase after every new thing we came across.

Fortunately, desire dopamine has a partner, control dopamine, to introduce some thoughtful consideration. The control circuit begins in the same place as the desire circuit but follows a different path. Instead of releasing its dopamine in the limbic system, where we modulate basic emotions, it directs its dopamine to the frontal lobes. That’s important because that’s where planning and calculation take place. The combination of limbic-system motivation and frontal-lobe calculation gives us profound power. First, the desire circuit creates interest in what’s possibly useful. Next, the control circuit lets us figure out if it is worth pursuing, and if so, how to go about pursuing it. It does so by supporting abstract thinking, providing focus, and giving us the ability to concentrate through complex mental tasks.

To reach our goals we need both subsystems working together.

THE BOTTOM LINE

The desire dopamine system motivates pursuit toward new or novel things that may have existential value, and it does so on the basis of allure instead of fact. To secure those things, the control dopamine system equips us with the power to imagine, plan, and execute.

SPECTACULAR UPSIDE #1: MENTAL TIME TRAVEL

When dopamine presents us with the urge to pursue some goal, it doesn’t make us feel desire, then leave us high and dry. Via control dopamine, it gives us the capacity to craft a plan to achieve the goal. For instance, it equips us to play out various scenarios: What would it be like if I get what I want? How hard might this be? What challenges could get in my way, and

how hard will it be to get around them? In this way we gain a logic-driven tool to compete with the emotional, dopaminergic urge—a rational capacity to help us decide if we want to pursue the possibility at all. This combination of applied reason, intuition, and imagination gives us the power of mental time travel.

There’s a restaurant near my house that makes a grilled chicken sandwich I like. I don’t have one now, but I can play out various scenarios to help me decide whether to get one. Do I want to spend the money? Would it be worth the trouble of driving over there? Or would I be just as happy staying home and microwaving leftovers? And if I decide to have the sandwich, control dopamine gives me the power to make a plan for getting it.

My decision about that chicken sandwich is a trivial matter in the grand scheme, but the ability to carry out this kind of analysis is indispensable to navigating daily life. To choose my future, I must first be able to imagine my future. I must have the capacity to engage in mental time travel, meaning I need the ability to envision various future possibilities, analyze them, and tweak them to reflect benefits and problems, then game out those possibilities. Control dopamine makes that possible.

Consider a consequential decision such as proposing marriage. Desire dopamine is what piques my interest in formalizing a relationship, and control dopamine enables me to plan how I might make the case to my partner. But control dopamine also lets me make the decision of whether or not to ask. It lets me envision what my married life would be like down to the slightest detail, consider the benefits and challenges, and possibly realize that I’m not cut out for marriage at all, or that I’m perfect for it. Desire dopamine attracts us with possibility. Control dopamine gives us the power not only to plan but also to pursue, temper, or abandon a choice. It does so by allowing us to create imaginary alternative futures from which we can choose the best path.

Using mental time travel, I can plop myself down in multiple situations, play out the benefits and drawbacks, and make a choice about the future without investing anything but my mental energy. No risk. No danger. No cost. For instance, if I’m thinking about buying a car, I can imagine what it would be like to own an expensive SUV versus an inexpensive compact, gaming out issues of price, value, repair, utility, reliability, safety, and

satisfaction. If I’m a college student, I can compare and contrast majors. If I’m a plumber, I can weigh the advantages of accessing a pipe through the tile inside the shower versus the drywall on the other side. As an engineer, I don’t need to wait until a bridge is built to see if it can handle the weight of the cars. I can use the abstract laws of physics to calculate it in advance. As human beings, we can even think about entire regimes of abstraction such as justice, morality, and aesthetic beauty. Humans have more dopamine than any other species. The result is nothing less than the ever-improving world we live in—all because, before it was real, we crafted it as a dopamine- powered possibility made from pure thought.

The future begins with the desire for more than we have right now. This urge to look beyond, and our ability to imagine how to get a thing that’s distant from us in time or space, equips us to make progress. “Never enough,” as Rainn Wilson put it, “has helped us as a species.”

THE BOTTOM LINE

Dopamine comes with a spectacular benefit: it gives us control across time and distance, enabling us to imagine things that we can’t yet possess or that do not yet exist. Dopamine also lets us manipulate abstractions and scenarios that exist only in the imagination. This skill, which we’ll call mental time travel, separates humans from other species and is vital to progress and creativity.

SPECTACULAR UPSIDE #2: THE POWER OF A GOOD

SURPRISE

The trigger for desire dopamine is not simply the opportunity to secure something of value. The thing that gets your attention must have the potential to make things better for you than you expect.

Let’s say it’s payday. My boss comes by my desk and hands me my weekly check. For the sake of easy arithmetic, we’ll imagine it’s $1,000. I stick it in my wallet and go back to work. There’s no dopamine buzz involved. But let’s say that this week, my check includes a $100 bonus, and

the note with the check says the boss has a new policy. From now on, she will sometimes add a bonus. Now I start looking forward to payday every week. But wait. It’s only a hundred bucks, and it’s not even a sure thing. Why was I not just as excited each week for the sure thing—which was ten times more than the bonus?

Dopamine is triggered by the potential to exceed our expectations in a good way—the power of a good surprise, or what we’ll call reward prediction error. I thought I was going to get the same check as always. Instead, it was one with an extra $100. This exceeded my expectations. From now on, I know that possibility exists every Friday. This looking- forward-to-it feeling that comes from even the slightest chance of more triggers the dopamine buzz. As for why I’m excited by the extra hundred bucks when I yawn at the usual thousand, note that the trigger for the good feeling isn’t the money itself. It’s the unexpected thrill of an error in expectation that leaves us not with less or the same but more.

If your partner surprises you this Friday with flowers, it will trigger the good feeling of a dopamine release. How good? The dopamine release will be proportional to the difference between what you expected (your partner’s arrival) and what actually happened (your partner plus flowers). But if he or she starts bringing home a bouquet every few weeks, your expectation of flowers will no longer be zero, so the dopamine release will be a little less each time. And if the one you love starts bringing home flowers every Friday, the dopamine release will return to zero because there’s no difference between what happened and what you expected. The flowers used to be like a little lottery win. Now they’ve become something like that regular paycheck.

We’ll return to this idea often. For instance, reward prediction error is why we keep scrolling through social media: Maybe the next thing I read will make me feel better than I do right now. It doesn’t happen every time but it’s happened before. Maybe it’ll happen again. It’s also the principle behind slot machines: Maybe the next pull will put money in my pocket. It’s happened before. Maybe it’ll happen again. Dopamine rewards us for pursuing even the most remote possibility of more.

THE BOTTOM LINE

Dopamine is triggered by reward prediction error: when there is a possibility for something to exceed our expectations, we get a anticipatory feeling that is unique and intense. But once we grow accustomed to the surprise—when it stops being a surprise—the dopamine thrill goes away.

THE GREATEST DANGER: WHY IT TAKES MORE AND

MORE TO FEEL LESS AND LESS

There’s another characteristic of the dopamine system that’s vital to know: the more frequently we stimulate any particular pathway in the dopamine system, the more stimulation is needed to get a response. Not only is dopamine on the lookout for “more,” over time it requires more more. That can lead us to overindulge in things that can be very dangerous.

When you first started drinking alcohol in your teens or twenties, you probably felt tipsy after only a few sips. If you started to drink regularly, it soon took a cocktail or two to get that same feeling. Over months or years, and depending on how frequently you imbibed, you likely reached the point where it took many drinks to get what only a few sips once achieved.

In other words, it takes more and more to feel less and less. Repeated journeys down a dopamine pathway produce this effect. The gratification fades a little each time until eventually there may be no gratification at all. Each experience raises our tolerance for stimulation: the more we indulge a particular dopamine reward, the less pleasure we get from it, so we end up reaching for more just to maintain it. This growing need for stimulation gets expressed in all sorts of adventurism, from mountain climbing to sex: every “next episode” has to be even more extreme—more stimulating, more frequent, or both—to feel only as good the last time out.*

There’s a better way. We can use our control dopamine system to moderate our choices, so that we don’t stimulate those pleasure centers so frequently and so strongly as to render them impotent. Consider a case far less serious than illegal drugs, but with a similar pattern. A few years ago, I started drinking Diet Dr Pepper. I loved it and drank four or five cans a day,

every day. Within a few months, though, I developed a complete distaste for it. I’d had too much, too often—too much stimulation and not enough time between indulgences to let my system return to a more normal, unstimulated state. If I had drunk less of it, and not had it every day, I might still be able to enjoy it. By choosing to pursue dopamine stimulation less often, we avoid “wearing out” the part of us that takes pleasure from it.

When we simply indulge dopamine for short-term pleasure with no regard for long-term damage—when we let the lure of desire dopamine overwhelm the judgment and planning of control dopamine—we can end up in endless pursuit. We chase satisfaction over and over, each time feeling it less and less, until we eventually arrive at this: I’m always going to feel this way. This never feels as good as it used to. And I see no way out. That’s when we may end up with an overdose.

For the details, consider what’s going on at the cellular level. A dopamine molecule brings about a feeling or urge when it encounters a dopamine receptor: the “lock” to the dopamine “key.” You can use a metal key thousands of times in the metal lock on your front door and it’ll always work the same way, but the dopamine lock is not nearly so resilient. If you stimulate the dopamine receptors too much and too often, the lock gets worn down. Some of those receptors simply stop working, leaving fewer places for the dopamine molecule to connect. Fewer receptor interactions weaken the effect—the good feeling you get—when dopamine is released. Now it takes more stimulation to get the same effect as before. Your tolerance has increased in a process called downregulation.

But doesn’t this point to a solution? If the receptors stop working, the pleasure goes away. And if the pleasure goes away, the pursuit of that pleasure should go away too. That would be true but for one other factor: dopamine produces not just pleasure but also craving, and craving does not downregulate and go away.

Consider someone addicted to cocaine. He started out using the drug because it made him high. After years of use he no longer gets the slightest pleasure from it. He has downregulated all his dopamine receptors into complete tolerance. Yet he keeps using the drug because even though the pleasure is gone, the dopamine-driven craving remains. The chemical

source of craving, found in the nucleus accumbens, is the engine of addiction: pleasure fades but the urge does not.*

Craving is encoded within the brain in ways that are similar to how we encode memories, and we all know how persistent unpleasant memories can be. Overcoming craving can take years, often requiring the assistance of family, friends, healthcare professionals, and support groups. Anti-craving medications, such as naltrexone for alcohol dependence and buprenorphine for opioids, can also be powerful tools in the fight. † But it’s difficult no matter what—doable, but difficult.

THE BOTTOM LINE

When dopamine pathways are too frequently activated, we build up a tolerance to their stimulation. That’s why we grow bored with some things and move on from them. But with certain kinds of overstimulation, especially from certain drugs and medications, we create an urge that doesn’t go away. This is the mechanism of addiction: the pleasure fades or even stops but the craving remains, and we change our behavior to satisfy it, often in damaging ways. A few medicines can keep addiction from consuming us, but most often we have to find professional support to build coping mechanisms and address underlying causes.

THE BALANCE OF POWER AND THE POWER OF

BALANCE

When it comes to creating a desirable future for ourselves, dopamine is vital as air, yet its power to make us despair—from too much anticipation or too little—is as common as a weapon at the scene of a crime. But with a basic understanding of the connection between dopamine and how it can make us feel, we are now better prepared to tame its undesirable effects.

On one end of the spectrum of dopamine experiences, there’s the lack of desire. An overall deficiency of dopamine and a lack of activity in the

desire system is often a significant factor in depression. It’s crushing to feel that there’s nothing you want and no one you care about. When even the desire to live is gone, a major depressive disorder can become a fatal illness. People who live with depression are twenty-five times more likely to take their own lives than the general population.9

At the other extreme, overwhelming desire pushes us toward constant, exhausting pursuit. Manic episodes are characterized by increased energy, restlessness, impulsivity, and the drive to engage in more activities than are practical. Among the main causes are too much dopamine, a too-busy desire dopamine system, and, in some cases, an overactive control dopamine system as well. There’s little or no interest in here-and-now pleasure, just a permanent state of striving, often accompanied by inflated self-esteem. A person with such a problem is consumed by unending effort toward the next achievement, a victory they won’t bother to pause and enjoy even if they get there. Perpetual, joy-free pursuit thus can become another type of addiction.

With these extremes in mind—profound lack of motivation at one end of the spectrum and obsession with pursuit on the other—we can more easily recognize where our own experiences fall. Are you concerned you are growing bored with something—a job, a relationship, a string of projects started and never finished? Have you experienced a dip in curiosity, motivation, or anticipation? These may be related to a lack of dopamine or dopamine activity. Near the other extreme, we may find ourselves with an interest in alcohol or drugs that interferes with our lives, an interest that is not quite or not yet an addiction. Or we may have problems with things we do. Perhaps we eat obsessively, or we engage in unwanted behaviors related to sex, food, shopping, or gaming, and we want to cut down or stop. Any of these things may be related to having too much dopamine.

When we fail to find pleasure in the things we have in the here and now, we need to diminish our reliance on dopaminergic anticipation and explore more deeply what we can experience with our five senses.

When we fail to find pleasure in anticipation, we need to raise our ability to look forward and engage with our curiosity and the unknown.

We must balance where we invest our energy and attention: the possibilities of the future should be balanced by the pleasures of the present,

and the anticipation of tomorrow should be balanced by the experiences of today.

Ideally, here’s what we’d like to happen every time we reach a goal. We stop to take in the pleasure of our newly-won whatever in the here and now. We indulge our senses. We take pride in what we’ve achieved. In a while, we will cast about for our next goal, and having found it we will begin to pursue it. At that point our here-and-now enjoyment will slowly and reasonably give way to another round of dopamine-driven motivation and the pleasure of anticipation.

Building this balance between the dopamine system and the here-and- now neurotransmitters is a matter of weighing what we have against what we want, the pleasure of what is versus the possibility of what could be— or, as I’ve written before, creating a livable balance between wanting and having. In a full and satisfying life, we appreciate both. It is in asserting control over the dopaminergic urge that we find a satisfying way to live.

This balancing act determines nothing less than our capacity to find peace and fulfillment in life. We have to be mindful of the risks and rewards of our attraction to the future. At the same time, we must make a conscious, purposeful choice to appreciate the present, especially in the period just after we’ve reached a goal. It’s not easy. Not only does dopamine make anticipation and planning an intoxicating experience, it also makes us overestimate how satisfying any achievement will be. Think of how you felt when you started your first job. You worked hard to earn it. You believed it would be the key to happiness. Yet months later you may have found yourself wondering, What else is out there? The job was probably just fine, but “just fine” is the enemy of the dopaminergic urge.

We aren’t wired for “good enough.” We’re wired for more. Let’s investigate how to tame this demanding molecule for a better life.

* There’s a third dopamine system, but we won’t address it here because it deals mostly with motor control. If you wonder why a Google search on “dopamine” yields so many hits for Parkinson’s disease, that’s why. Parkinson’s primarily affects motion. † A dopamine molecule causes one set of effects upon receptors in the desire system and a different set of effects on receptors in the control system. For convenience, let’s refer to this distinction as different types or kinds of dopamine, as we did in the first book—for instance, “control

dopamine” refers not to a unique kind of dopamine molecule but to “activity in the control dopamine system.” * People who abuse certain drugs sometimes experience this dopamine-driven experience in the most merciless way possible. A single use of certain drugs can in some cases warp the desire dopamine system so that the person’s tolerance becomes infinite: no matter how much of the drug they take, no pleasure is possible at all. So they continue to take more and more, leading to overdose and death. * Withdrawal is painful. It is the body attempting to return to normal function after its systems were warped by abuse. But withdrawal symptoms tend to fade. The primary engine of addiction is still craving. † The new weight-loss drug semaglutide and related medications appear to diminish cravings of many kinds, not just for food. Later in the book, I’ll explore what this might mean for a broad range of dopamine-driven problems, including addiction itself.

P

art II is a guide to raising and lowering your overall dopamine levels. If you feel that your levels are problematically too low or too high, this section will give you specific techniques to help change that. If you feel your levels are likely normal but you’d like to raise or lower them to try for some particular improvement in feeling or performance, I’ll address that too. (In part III, I’ll provide detailed support for particular dopamine-related problems.) I’ll also share a preview of dopamine- impacting treatments now in development. Finally, I’ll provide a guide to therapeutic approaches to dopamine-related issues.

What does it mean to have low levels of dopamine? In broad terms, low dopamine presents as a lack of interest in new or typically intriguing things, and diminished interest in pursuing activities and answers that were formerly far more interesting. People with low dopamine often complain of a lack of motivation, an inability to concentrate, depression or “the blues,” brain fog, and a reduced interest in sex. A common symptom of depression is the inability to experience pleasure; this is associated with reduced dopamine signaling.

What does it mean to have elevated levels of dopamine? Elevated dopamine presents as decreased impulse control, excess energy, and sometimes aggression. Symptoms vary with the person but can also include racing thoughts and an affinity for risk-taking to the point that it becomes a problem.* In the case of certain serious mental illnesses, some people may experience hallucinations, delusions, mania, and even psychosis.

If you’re experiencing a cluster of the feelings or behaviors just described, the techniques in this part of the book may be a helpful place to begin your efforts. (If you’re in acute distress, you believe your issues require professional support, or you’re just more comfortable working with someone, call a psychiatrist or a psychologist.) Improvement can come not only as a result of a genuine change in dopamine levels and activity but also via the general enhancement of your mental state these practices can bring about. Either way is fine because the outcome is that you feel better.

* Elevated dopamine is often associated with anxiety, but that in fact can be caused by both too much dopamine and too little, depending on where in the brain the activity occurs. For instance, elevated dopamine in the cognitive control and executive function pathways is associated with increased anxiety, while too little dopamine can cause anxiety if it occurs in the reward circuits. Also, dopamine isn’t the only factor in anxiety. Other things matter, too, such as genetics, environmental influence, personal experience, and dopamine’s interaction with other neurotransmitters such as GABA and glutamate.

### Chapter 2: Boosting Dopamine

Chapter 2

BOOSTING DOPAMINE

CAN WE OVERCLOCK THE BRAIN?

If we want more dopamine, can we get it? Is there a pill? Is there a procedure?

For many, a healthy brain is not enough. No surprise there, since dopamine makes us want more of everything, often including dopamine itself. It’s seductive, this prospect of firing up the brain to raise our performance past normal. After all, Lexapro lifts the mood of depressed people. Can it do the same for those of us who aren’t depressed? Adderall improves the cognitive functioning of people with ADHD. Can the rest of us get that, too? In general, no. We can “turn the dial” from below normal up to normal, but we don’t have much of a way to keep turning it, at least not for long and not without problems. “Normalizing” interventions are rarely capable of more than that.

A computer chip with a faulty clock will run slow or not at all. If we fix it, we’ll see a substantial increase in performance—back to normal. But for a chip that’s working the way it’s supposed to, there’s not much we can do to squeeze out greater performance. Some people overclock their computer processors to get a little more speed, but the difference is subtle and they risk frying the chip. The brain is not so different. Those who try to “overclock” it with psychotropic compounds meant for other purposes often pay a high price in the form of addiction, depression, anxiety, or some other mental disorder.

Yet the prospect of taking control of the brain and making ourselves smarter or more productive “beyond normal” is so tempting that many people ignore the risks and try anyway. The failures and tragedies are well documented and plentiful. Success stories are few and far between, and “good” outcomes are mostly in the eye of the beholder, such as with the use of nootropic* compounds and dietary supplements. Some people report improvement, though this may be the placebo effect. Much of the research into these uses has yet to establish clear and consistent cause and effect.

As the next section describes, the body fights hammer and tong against the addition of dopamine itself to the brain. What we have for now are treatments that increase the activity of dopamine within the brain, but only under certain conditions and only in certain systems. These are often dopamine agonists, meaning they improve function by increasing the activity at dopamine receptors. Even so, the approach is still subject to the “not much beyond normal” limitation.

WHY CAN’T I JUST GET A DOPAMINE SHOT?

In general, when we’re short on some chemical in our body, we extract it from a human or animal source or whip it up in the lab, then take it in a shot or a pill. When diabetics need insulin, they take an injection. When you need to strengthen your bones, you take vitamin D. Why not do the same with dopamine?

The brain lives behind an elaborate filter called the blood–brain barrier (BBB). The BBB isn’t a structure like the heart or the kidneys. It’s everywhere throughout the brain, formed by special cells that line its capillaries, and it’s huge. An adult has about two square meters of skin; the area covered by the BBB is eight times that.10 The purpose of the BBB is to protect the brain and the central nervous system from toxic substances in the blood by rejecting molecules with certain qualities. This is where dopamine enters the picture—or, rather, does not.

First, dopamine is a polar molecule, meaning it has regions of positive and negative charge. The BBB blocks highly polarized molecules. Second, dopamine is a large molecule, meaning it has a relatively high molecular weight.* The BBB blocks large molecules too. This is why we can’t

introduce dopamine directly into the brain; for now there’s no other practical channel of access.† This tells us something else too. Since there’s no way to bring dopamine across the BBB, all the dopamine we use in the brain has to be made there. We could inject it all day long and not fix the problem. It would just float around in the bloodstream and never end up where it needs to be.‡

When we talk about increasing dopamine levels, we most often mean increasing dopamine activity by causing the dopamine receptors in the brain to keep the molecule around longer than they normally would. Doctors do this through compounds known as dopamine reuptake inhibitors (DRIs). This term may sound familiar because it is similar to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the most commonly used class of antidepressant and anti-anxiety drugs. SSRIs make serotonin stick around longer in its receptor: after the serotonin molecule makes its connection, the SSRI keeps it from being swept away from its receptor as quickly as it otherwise would. The goal is to reduce feelings of depression or anxiety and elevate mood. In the same way, DRIs cause dopamine molecules to stick around longer in their receptors, extending the associated dopamine effect.

At this time, our main way of making the brain create more dopamine is to take in more of the chemical precursor to dopamine, the compound levodopa, or L-dopa, prescribed in a pill or as a transdermal patch. This compound is not without significant side effects and, as a matter of mechanics, it’s kind of a bank shot—but it works, and it helps people greatly. L-dopa can do something dopamine cannot: it can cross the BBB and enter the brain itself. Once in the nervous system, additional chemical processes convert it to dopamine, though it’s the kind associated with motion receptors. That’s why L-dopa is a first-line treatment for Parkinson’s disease. It would be valuable to have an L-dopa-like molecule that could become active in the control or desire dopamine circuits, but so far we haven’t found it.

WELLBUTRIN, ADDERALL, SUGAR PILLS, AND LIES

Let’s consider the potential for a dopamine boost from some more familiar prescriptions.

One of the most successful antidepressants is Wellbutrin. It has a special place in the hearts of psychiatrists because it treats depression just as well as other antidepressants without causing one of their most common side effects, sexual dysfunction. Unlike those drugs, Wellbutrin doesn’t relieve anxiety or boost stress resilience, but it comes with other advantages. For instance, it can increase a patient’s engagement with the world and make it easier for them to enjoy ordinary pleasures, including sex. It can boost interest, motivation, and the ability to experience pleasure. And it won’t lead to addiction. Wellbutrin also boosts dopamine, but it delivers this effect only for patients with below-normal dopamine performance. For those blessed not to suffer from depression, Wellbutrin will not boost motivation, interest, or pleasurable response to pleasurable experiences.

Next, consider Adderall, the brand name for the stimulant known as amphetamine. Adderall modifies the behavior of the dopamine desire and control circuits. If you have attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), these circuits function abnormally and Adderall can make a difference. Modifying the desire circuit helps reduce impulsivity. For the control circuit, the effect is improved focus, concentration, and executive functioning (organizing, planning, and prioritizing). In addition to these desired effects, Adderall can also cause euphoria, elevated energy, and increased motivation.

If you don’t have a diagnosed attention disorder and you’re taking Adderall just for the anticipated effects, however, you’ll likely run into significant trouble. You’ll very soon find that you can never get enough euphoria and mental energy, and there’s no natural brake in place to stop you from getting more of it. We know what usually happens when we can have all of a thing we want with no limits. Fortunately, most pleasures come with built-in guardrails. Sex, for instance, is a natural form of gratification with natural limitations, such as finding someone who wants you in the first place. But there’s no such limit on stimulants that come out of a lab, especially one that makes us feel like a million bucks. Increased energy, motivation, and euphoria last only a while. The brain adjusts its tolerance, and after a few days or weeks the effects go away, so we increase the dose. The most likely result is that we take more and more of the drug until we overdose.

Another problem with the mood-boosting effects of stimulants is that the way you feel can be very different from how others see you. One user described feeling “charming, witty, and clever,” while his family described him as “arrogant, snide, and condescending.”11 Overclocking the dopamine system in this way can wreck our otherwise casual ability to interact with people in a reasonable way.

At this point, though, we encounter what makes Adderall so valuable for people who have a dopamine deficiency and actually need it. Among people with ADHD, and only among those people, the brain makes a weird and welcome exception: it doesn’t develop tolerance for the drug and it doesn’t downregulate the system, at least not for its desirable effects. Once a doctor finds the right dose, there’s no need to keep increasing it. The patient can use it long term to enjoy normal levels of focus, concentration, and executive functioning. It’s not clear why this happens but it does. Adderall is profoundly useful if you need it, and profoundly dangerous if you don’t, as it can send a healthy brain sideways, potentially toward dangerous, even deadly outcomes: mania, psychosis, and death.

None of that has diminished the popularity of Adderall as an occasional brain booster. One survey found that about 1 in 12 students reported taking it for nonmedical use.12 What might that use be? Here’s a hint: Consumption tends to peak around final exams. A group of scientists conducted an analysis of campus wastewater* during final exam week, then compared the data to what they measured in wastewater in the first week of classes, and found the levels of amphetamine rose 760% during finals.13

But these students aren’t gaining the advantage they believe. Investigators administered a battery of neurocognitive tests to a group of student volunteers, eight hours per subject, twice for each person, once with Adderall and once with capsules containing an inert powder. The results were the same under both conditions.14

Unless you have ADHD, you don’t get “smarter” using Adderall. Other studies have found similar results. Yet in a 2021 survey of surveys, as many as 34% of college students were using stimulant medication to try to boost their academic performance.15

So why do students keep at it? Because what matters is the outcome. They really are experiencing a boost in performance, but not for the reasons

they think.

Behold, the power of a lie. If you give someone a placebo and tell them it’s a stimulant, they’ll perform better than if you give them a stimulant and tell them it’s a placebo. In other words, convincing yourself of your edge is more powerful than ingesting some chemical. Scientists call this a “robust” placebo effect, and it means just what the word “robust” suggests: it’s strong, vigorous, and better than expected. Scientists don’t know the method of action for why this happens. They know only that it does. A little more energy might help you at exam time, but there’s no line we can draw between that and being genuinely “smarter.” All we know for sure is that it’s as effective to believe you’re taking a stimulant as it is to actually use one. Safer too.

And so far on our search, we’re still not finding a drug that boosts normal dopamine levels.

EAT THIS

Next, let’s look beyond formally-approved pharmaceuticals to over-the- counter supplements. But first a little history.

For nearly two centuries, you could walk into any US pharmacy and buy any medicine you wanted. In 1938, the federal government took away that choice in the name of consumer protection, collecting a catalog of compounds into a category for which a doctor’s permission was needed for purchase. (That list, later expanded into five “schedules,” has since expanded further to include four hundred or more drugs, with more added every year.) This system prioritizes minimizing risk at the expense of consumer choice and speed-to-market. That makes most people safer. But for those who are suffering with unusual symptoms or maladies, it creates a potentially life-and-death problem. If they want to try a drug that is not yet tested to current medical standards, they can’t. Mercifully, after a half century of this regime, and with so many new potential treatments being offered, Washington carved out some exceptions.

The passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 allowed manufacturers to bring vitamins, herbs, botanicals, and oils to market without the extensive testing required of pharmaceutical agents.

Maybe they will help and maybe they won’t. Maybe the outcome depends on the person, or the particulars of the condition. Whatever the case, people were free to choose their own balance between risk and reward. That’s a good thing. But this also opened the door wide to dubious claims and false hopes.

Nutritional supplements that claim to boost dopamine are plentiful, carrying names such as NeuroSpark, Dopamine Brain Food, and DopaRush Cocktail. They promise benefits such as renewed energy, elevated mood and focus, and even better memory. Do these alleged dopamine “supplements” work?

You can’t boost dopamine by simply consuming dopamine because, as discussed, dopamine can’t get through the blood-brain barrier. But the most common ingredient in these supplements, L-tyrosine, can. L-tyrosine is a precursor to L-dopa, a dopamine precursor. A common claim is that getting more of L-tyrosine could boost dopamine levels in your brain.

Can it? In a word, no. That’s like saying if I eat some calcium, I may grow more teeth.

Just because the raw material is present doesn’t guarantee that the body will use it the way you hope. It may not use it at all. Or the extra stuff may throw off other systems that were working just fine until you started honking around. The brain creates and regulates dopamine using many complex processes. It’s as yet unproven that we can accelerate those processes simply by adding more raw material to the mix. You might as well try to make a bigger cake by adding a whole bag of flour.

When it comes to supplements, the shelves are filled with breathless promises about dopamine levels and dopamine-related issues. In 2009, the National Institutes of Health sponsored a large study to test whether Ginkgo biloba extract improves cognitive health in the elderly.16 It didn’t. Researchers tracked more than three thousand volunteers for an average of six years. Ginkgo biloba did no better than placebo. Other supplements that are marketed as boosting dopamine do seem to have some effect on mental performance but not because they boost dopamine. L-theanine, which is found in tea, appears to increase mental alertness while relaxing the mind, but the dopamine connection is a maybe at best. Theanine* achieves its effects by modulating multiple neurotransmitters and receptors in complex

ways we don’t fully understand.17 A lot of companies are slapping “Dopamine Booster” on their products on the basis of inconclusive studies and wishful thinking.

In defense of supplements, these products tend to have good safety records, and most people use them as supplements, not cures. 79% of American adults say they take at least one nutritional supplement.18 Total supplement spending is more than $30 billion a year. And even if these products don’t work inside the body the way they’re advertised, they can still be useful. Remember the placebo effect? People who take supplements tend to be living a pretty healthy life anyway. If these supplements encourage them and don’t cause problems, that’s a good thing. People who report consuming nutritional supplements also tend to report that they are in excellent health, drink alcohol only moderately, don’t smoke cigarettes, and exercise frequently.19 These are health-conscious people who are trying to maximize their physical and mental abilities.

There’s little harm in experimenting to see what most so-called dopamine supplements can do, but they’re unlikely to produce a true dopamine boost or dramatically improve focus, concentration, motivation, or energy. There is no substitute for a compound tested in rigorous human trials, and nothing out there now is a valid replacement for tested medicines. When it comes to neuro-enhancement, begin with common sense: if it sounds too good to be true, it almost certainly is.

PROMISING NOISES FROM YOUR STOMACH

Finally, let’s consider one of the newest fields of research in this area. What benefits might lie in manipulating one of our most mysterious internal systems, the “gut biome”?

Your body is like a bustling metropolis and its hustling citizens are microbes—bacteria, viruses, and fungi. There are trillions of them covering your skin and colonizing your intestines. Some are harmful and can cause illness. Some are helpful, even essential, to healthy physiological functioning, and they do remarkable things. Microorganisms in the stomach, intestines, and colon comprise the “gut microbiome” or “gut biome,” a natural ecosystem of microbes that help break down food, aid

digestion, and more. They’re involved in the production of essential vitamins such as vitamin K, for blood clotting and bone-building; and some of the B vitamins, which support the mechanics of metabolism and have to be replenished regularly, since the body can’t store them. These microorganisms also support the immune system, thus protecting the body from pathogenic microorganisms with less noble goals. But the most interesting thing they do in terms of our interest is produce compounds that influence how the brain functions.

Most of us would be surprised to learn that the gut and the brain communicate, and not just about what we’d like for dinner. Some of these signals travel through a network of nerve cells. Others take a more surprising route: they are transmitted via psychoactive chemicals that travel from the gut to the brain via the bloodstream.

Researchers, drug developers, and healthcare providers are increasingly interested in whether mental illnesses can be treated by manipulating the gut biome. Early results are encouraging. Working with volunteers who had major depressive disorder, scientists treated them with a probiotic supplement that contained three strains of bacteria:20 Lactobacillus acidophilus, commonly found in yogurt; Lactobacillus casei, used in making cheese; and Bifidobacterium bifidum, found in the human intestine and essential to life. Researchers introduced no directly psychoactive pharmaceuticals; this was an experiment with supplements alone in the form of bacteria. The results: Volunteers who took the probiotic had lower depression scores than those who didn’t. Similar findings have been reported for anxiety. As with depression, anxiety is related to dopamine function, and these bacteria seem to alleviate some measure of both.

This points us to an interesting possibility: Could these bacteria be part of new treatments for people who don’t respond to medications? And to return to our original interest, are there any strains of bacteria that might provide a dopamine boost to an otherwise healthy person?

Scientists at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine addressed this last question directly. They examined the exercise habits of mice, some of whom spent considerably more time than others on the exercise wheel. They first sequenced the animals’ genomes and studied various metabolites* in their bloodstreams, but neither effort explained the

difference.21 It wasn’t until they focused on the microbiome that answers began to emerge. To confirm that it was the microbiome that was driving the exercise, they took some of the high-performing mice and treated them with antibiotics to kill their gut bacteria. The results were dramatic: the amount of time spent on the exercise wheel dropped by 50%.

Next, they bred germ-free mice—that is, mice born without any microorganisms in their gut. These mice didn’t show much interest in exercising until researchers did a switch by transferring microbiome samples from high-performing mice to the germ-free ones. Afterward, the low performers improved to the point where their output closely matched that of the donor mice. Using antibiotics that selectively eliminated only certain strains of bacteria, researchers eventually found two specific strains that were responsible for the exercise boost: Eubacterium rectale and Coprococcus eutactus. These bacteria were producing special metabolites called fatty acid amines that led to increased levels of dopamine during exercise, which boosted motivation—at least for exercising, and at least among mice. Voilà—a dopamine boost for those who are otherwise normal!

How this might lead to benefits for the rest of us is yet to be determined, but let’s consider a few things we might try right now. If microbiomes really do enhance dopaminergic motivation, we can improve them right away. Western diets foster poor microbiomes. A good way to start fixing that is to add fiber and fermented foods to your diet. Probiotic supplements might also produce some benefits. Even if they don’t specifically include E. rectale and C. eutactus, they may still be helpful: administering the common probiotic Lactobacillus casei can increase levels of other beneficial strains, including C. eutactus and E. rectale.22 They also inhibit growth of some harmful bacteria. Other bacterial strains may have as-yet- unknown benefits. Prebiotics, which consist of soluble fiber acting as a kind of fertilizer for the gut, also promote the growth of C. eutactus and E. rectale. If you’re trying to boost your motivation to exercise, a couple of teaspoons of whole or ground chia seeds might be a helpful addition to your daily diet, since their prebiotic fiber affects the growth of some of the bacterial groups at issue.23

STILL LOOKING

We set out to find ways to boost dopamine in healthy people and came up empty but it was still a useful exercise. In this new realm of medical possibilities, it’s good to know what’s already possible versus not yet possible, and why. Equipped with this kind of knowledge, we’re less likely to fall for marketing that makes hope feel like fact—which, ironically, is the same thing desire dopamine does.

We’ve also ended with a little optimism on where progress might come: the gut biome may someday give us a way to boost exercise motivation. That’s not the dopamine boost we were looking for, but if it leads to a treatment that really does motivate exercise, the impact will be lifesaving for some and life extending for us all. Even a little regular exercise reduces the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes, and many other deadly illnesses. In terms of the brain, exercise directly improves cognitive functioning and boosts mood. Since more than 75% of Americans don’t get enough exercise, in part from lack of motivation, a gut biome treatment that provides that motivation would be worth billions in new business, billions more in savings on healthcare costs, and years of longer, more satisfying life for many people—all from restoring a bit of motivation toward a common, or lately uncommon, act. The long reach of dopamine produces effects in every part of life.

It would be great to find a pharmaceutical—or a food, or a dietary supplement, or an altered piece of DNA, or a bacterium, virus, or fungus— that we could swallow like an aspirin to boost dopamine levels and benefits beyond normal, but right now there isn’t one. When we try to push standard function beyond its limits, the results can include depression, addiction, and anxiety. Often the result is no change at all. Certain pharmaceuticals can restore function to a faulty dopamine system, but those compounds typically boost availability of the dopamine that’s already in a healthy brain without increasing how much dopamine is there.

If we ever achieve neuro-enhancement for dopamine, the first successes may come from manipulation of the gut biome. Then again, science is about looking in new directions, so maybe the first breakthrough will come out of the blue. However it happens, it will come to pass because dopamine is ultimately the source of our motivation in this—as in everything.

* Nootropic comes from the Ancient Greek for “mind” (noos) and “turning” (trope). It refers to compounds that enhance learning and memory, and build resistance to disruption of learned behaviors, doing so without making you sleepy or high. If you haven’t seen this word before, it’s because it’s fairly new. It didn’t appear until 1972, in a medical research paper by a Romanian chemist named Corneliu E. Giurgea who, conveniently, also provided this definition in his paper. * Such molecules are typically biologics, meaning they come from other living organisms, and this may be a clue as to why the BBB blocks them. There could be something dangerous about swapping molecules among living things that we don’t fully understand. After all, the BBB is a product of evolution, so this quality of the barrier developed as a response over time to something we may not have seen in modern medicine. † We can get around the BBB by going through the spine, but it’s risky and requires a highly controlled environment. Also, dopamine acts and recedes far too rapidly for this approach to help for very long. ‡ Dopamine is found in the bloodstream, but its function there appears unrelated to behavior. It is a local paracrine messenger, meaning that it sends a signal to cause changes in nearby cells. * Wastewater contains urine and Adderall can be detected in urine. * The terms theanine and L-theanine are used interchangeably. The “L” indicates the biologically active form, meaning a chemical structure inclined to interact with living organisms. For you chemistry enthusiasts, the two molecules are isomers, meaning they have the same number and types of atoms but in a different structural arrangement. * This sentence contains a couple terms that get tossed around a lot but are not in the working vocabulary of many people outside a biology lab, so let’s clear up things. A genome is the blueprint or DNA for a living creature, including biological “plans” for growth and development. A metabolite is a product of chemical processes in the body.

### Chapter 3: The Dopamine Fast

Chapter 3

THE DOPAMINE FAST

FIRST, IT’S NOT REALLY A FAST

You want to go on a dopamine fast? Congratulations, you’re already doing it.

Recall that you don’t acquire dopamine by ingesting it. Every bit of it you have is made inside your brain. You could drink a tall glass of dopamine and your body would prevent every molecule from reaching the structures where it could influence your mood and outlook. That internal dopamine factory you have is humming along all on its own, thanks, and it requires neither your attention nor your consent to carry out its many jobs.

Besides, while you may sometimes feel overwhelmed by dopamine- driven effects, you don’t want to eliminate dopamine entirely. You can’t. Your body wouldn’t function without it. When an infection co-opts your circulatory system, you don’t suggest getting rid of your blood for a while.

“That’s not what I mean,” you say. “I want to temporarily eliminate dopamine-boosting experiences.” Okay, but pretty much everything is a dopaminergic experience of some kind. Other than knocking yourself unconscious, you can’t step back, not even for a second.

What you can do, though, is reduce or eliminate certain clear-cut kinds of dopamine stimulation that are problematic, and that’s what a dopamine fast really is—a little less dopamine action in certain mental transactions. This can restore your tolerances and expectations back to normal and help you enjoy a more satisfying life. You’d like to feel less frantic, to have more

control, and to experience some relief from motivations, attractions, even compulsions, that can be exhausting, overwhelming, and sometimes irresistible. By dramatically reducing stimulation for a time, you give the brain the opportunity to reset what has been damaged by overuse, resensitizing the dopamine system to more subtle forms of stimulation. And by using that time to create new habits and a foundation of knowledge to support better choices, we can make this desensitization less likely to reoccur.

GETTING BACK TO EVEN

The term dopamine fast was coined by Cameron Sepah, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of California, San Francisco.24 It’s a strategy to take advantage of homeostatic mechanisms the body uses to adjust to changing environmental circumstances. There’s a lot of unfamiliar language in there that’s important to understand, so let’s unpack it.

The word homeostasis comes from Greek roots that mean “to stay the same,” which is a high priority for the body. That’s why human evolution has created so many mechanisms to keep systems and organs working within optimal ranges. If you get too hot, your body sweats to cool you down. If you get too cold, you shiver, and that heats you up. The eye maintains the optimal intensity of light getting through to the retina by contracting the iris in bright environments and dilating it when the light is dim. These physiologic (bodily) tendencies are what we’re talking about when we refer to typical homeostatic mechanisms. Where problems begin is in their frequent overuse.

For instance, many common foods have sugar added at the factory— bread, pasta sauce, salad dressing, canned soup, even coleslaw—yet we don’t find these foods sweet. The homeostatic mechanisms associated with taste have raised our tolerance for sensing when something is sweet. This is another example of downregulation, the same process that occurs in the dopamine circuits and many other biological systems. If you eat a typical US diet, it takes a great deal of sweetness for you to notice sweetness at all. But if you avoided all forms of sugar for even a month, that downregulation would turn to upregulation, making you especially sensitive to the thing

that you’d been abstaining from. After resetting your homeostatic adaptation this way, a piece of bread would taste more like cake, and many other processed foods would be so sweet you might find them inedible.

Most of the things that give us pleasure are subject to homeostatic downregulation, meaning that when those things are repeated, they become less pleasurable. Lobster was once so plentiful on the Massachusetts coast that it was known as the “cockroach of the sea,” a meal fit only for prisoners and livestock. Inmates got sick of it not because of its taste but because they were overexposed to it. Today, though, lobster is a delicious experience in large part because you and I get it so rarely. In the movie Castaway, Tom Hanks is stranded on an island where for years he eats nothing but crab. When he is rescued, the lavish buffet at his welcoming gala features what’s special to his hosts, crab. He picks it up in disgust, his enjoyment of it having been reduced to nothing.

Which brings us back to the downregulation of dopamine. If you have several windows open and it’s suddenly very windy out, you’ll close some of them. Fewer open windows means it takes more wind for us to feel its effects inside. Similarly, when the brain experiences a high jolt of dopamine, it “closes some windows”—it reduces the number of dopamine receptors that can catch and respond to dopamine molecules. The more often these spikes of stimulation happen, as with frequent use of certain drugs, the more of these receptors are shut down long term, some forever. Fewer available receptors means it takes more dopamine stimulation for us to feel the kick. Downregulation is the mechanism of desensitization.

It works the other way too. Upregulation is the restoration and repopulation of dopamine receptors. It happens when dopamine-driven stimulation is significantly reduced for an extended time. Unless you’ve warped the system permanently from extreme use, long-term abuse, or both, the receptor count returns to normal along with our response to stimulation.

This purposeful cutback—not a complete cutoff—is dopamine fasting. The goal isn’t to shut down the dopamine system, which is impossible anyway. It’s to resensitize the system to more subtle forms of stimulation, which leads to more complex and satisfying experiences of pleasure.

MISTAKES TO AVOID

A 2019 article in the New York Times, “How to Feel Nothing Now, in Order to Feel More Later,”25 is the account of two entrepreneurs who periodically engaged in a day of greatly decreased activity. Their goal was to get as close as possible to the point of feeling nothing, which they believed would hasten the restoration of dopamine sensitivity. “We’re addicted to dopamine,” one said. “And because we’re getting so much of it all the time, we end up just wanting more and more, so activities that used to be pleasurable now aren’t. Frequent stimulation of dopamine gets the brain’s baseline higher.”

On dopamine-fasting days, the entrepreneurs held to strict rules: no eating, no looking at screens, no listening to music, no exercise, no touching another person’s body (not even a handshake), no work, no eye contact, and no talking unless “absolutely necessary.” The photographer who took their picture for the article wasn’t allowed to use a flash because the two were afraid the sudden change in light might stimulate dopamine. Some of this was a good idea, but most of it was useless, even counterproductive.

They were on the right track when they eliminated work. Work is typically future oriented: we invest our time and resources today for income, recognition, or power tomorrow. That’s dopamine-driven activity. Avoiding screentime also made sense. Much of what we do on computers and cell phones is planning and abstraction, so screens are a dopamine stimulant, and we can turn them off. The rest of their approach mostly replaced precise choices with blunt force. This took away more than dopamine, and that was costly.

When they deprived themselves of dopaminergic stimulation, they cut themselves off from the pleasures of the H&N system too. As they pushed away the often-empty anticipatory excitement of dopamine, they also pushed away the thing that has to take its place.

To begin with, they cut themselves off from social interaction. Sometimes we interact with others for a future purpose, but more often it’s simply for the enjoyment of being with people, a powerful pleasure delivered in part by the H&N neurotransmitter oxytocin. Consider something as simple as a smile. Researchers at Hewlett-Packard used a brain scanner and heart rate monitor to measure “mood-boosting values” for

various stimuli. They estimated that a smile was as pleasurable and stimulating as getting 2,000 bars of chocolate or $25,000.26* If we smile to help create a better future—to initiate a new relationship, to make ourselves more attractive to a potential employer, or to put a potential client at ease— then the activity is almost entirely dopaminergic. But how often do you present a calculated smile? Most of the time you’re just happy. Or consider the stimulation of the exercise they set aside. A runner’s high feels so intense that you might assume it’s a dopamine-driven experience, but it’s not. Runner’s high is from endorphin, another H&N neurotransmitter. It creates a feeling of fulfillment and satisfaction, which is the opposite of the urge for more that dopamine delivers.

The combination of all this avoidance denied the entrepreneurs yet another benefit. Dopamine and H&Ns can suppress one another. When you’re at dinner, deeply engaged in discussing plans for tomorrow, you’re not much engaged with the tastes, smells, and textures of the meal you’re eating. Conversely, when you’re appreciating the mouthfeel of pasta or the smoky-sweet taste of the cumin in the dish in front of you, debating how to write tomorrow’s TPS report is far from top of mind. In this way H&N pleasures can help lower dopamine activity and promote resensitization.

A dopamine fast has to be accompanied by purposeful H&N stimulation, which creates enormous pleasure that doesn’t lead to craving. Besides the intrinsic value of in-the-moment enjoyment, and the importance of shifting toward the senses and away from anticipation, the H&N experience reinforces what we need to remember in order to live better: great pleasure is possible somewhere other than the dopamine treadmill. Many wonderful, valuable things are satisfying in the moment and that’s enough. By depriving themselves of a wealth of here-and-now pleasures, the entrepreneurs made their “fast” more difficult to maintain, and they missed out on building the habits and experience base they were going to need to permanently lower their attraction to dopamine.

Finally, the entrepreneurs mistakenly tried to modify their brains through an occasional intense day of heroic deprivation. That was never going to work. Some bodily systems can change fast. When it’s too dark to see, the iris reacts immediately, but brain systems such as dopamine circuits change slowly. Consider how long it takes to learn a new language or

master a new skill. An occasional full day of practice isn’t going to do it. Success depends on long-term commitment and frequent repetition. Upregulation is literally the restoration of dopamine receptors at the cellular level. They don’t pop up like mushrooms after a rainstorm.

YOUR DOPAMINE FAST

To be successful, your dopamine fast should be built on incremental changes in the short term toward creating permanent habits in the long term. As you plan your dopamine fast, build it around these foundational approaches.

Treat it like working out. Think of this effort the same way you might think of starting out at the gym. Beginners are the most eager to see change. They want to feel healthy and look great, and they want it as soon as possible. Like the fasting entrepreneurs, they adopt the attitude that if doing a little is good, then doing a lot must be better, and exercising to exhaustion is surely best of all. You already know how the story ends: they work too hard on the first day, can barely move the next, then try to forget the whole failed effort. This approach never works. The smart way is to start with small changes and build on them slowly over time. That’s as true for changing the way you deal with dopamine as it is for exercise.

Start with small things and do them daily. Reduce dopamine stimulation at predetermined times of the day. Instead of playing a video game or watching TikTok videos, read a novel or talk to someone. Choose some time each day when you avoid sugar or shopping or your Facebook app. Anything that gets you away from the dopamine lure is good; anything that replaces it with H&N activities is better. Just be sure to do the things you’ve chosen every day. Occasional abstinence from dopaminergic activities won’t lead to long-term changes in the brain. Treat it like exercise. It’s better to take a brisk walk every day than to do a hard run once a week.

Don’t cut back, cut it out. As you choose things to do and to avoid, remember that the most effective approach is to choose a small, habitual thrill that means little to you and eliminate it completely, rather than incrementally cutting back. If you do it halfway, your craving for the dopamine hit will never go away, and eventually your willpower will be

exhausted. That’s why people who become dependent on alcohol can almost never go back to moderate drinking. The ordinary dopaminergic thrills most people indulge in aren’t as addictive as alcohol, but the rule is the same. If you go back and forth, it will always be a struggle.

Eliminating the thrill completely, by contrast, usually ends up being easier than people expect. Do you check your cell phone first thing in the morning? Stop. You might feel anxious and off balance for a little while. The sudden loss of dopamine stimulation might even leave you feeling resentful and deprived. But if you stick it out, those feelings will soon fade. With that victory under your belt, you’ll be surprised at how easy the new habit is to maintain. You may even find your former attraction has turned to revulsion. Some people who give up sugar move beyond disinterest to rather strange feelings. They say that after a while, when they look at sugary foods, these former treats no longer register as edible. A piece of cake might as well be a stapler. Their brain tells them that it isn’t even food.

Think hard about what’s necessary versus what only seems that way. There’s no obstacle to completely eliminating drugs and alcohol from a person’s life. The same isn’t true of some dopaminergic things like social media, shopping, and sex. In these cases, the goal is to distinguish between what is necessary for one’s work or personal life, and what’s being done solely for the pleasure of anticipating dopamine. Be honest with yourself. As you choose, remind yourself why you’re doing this in the first place: to feel better over time. It’s a dopaminergic goal well worth some dopamine denial. You’ll get better at it every day.

Don’t torture yourself with a goal of feeling nothing at all. The entrepreneurs from the article did that. It was a mistake. Feeling nothing is impossible. We’re human beings. Don’t set yourself up for failure by aiming for an outcome no one could achieve.

Keep in mind that big changes usually begin with unpleasant feelings, and those feelings will fade. The human body resists change—it seeks to maintain homeostasis—so it’s going to give you unpleasant feelings or even pain when you try to impose change. For instance, if you stop eating sugar, it can be pretty unpleasant for a while. Along with the resentment and deprivation, cravings might cause depression, anxiety, difficulties with sleep and concentration, and more. But this won’t last

forever. Some people feel better in a few days, others in a few weeks. And after the body readjusts, something wonderful happens: recovery.

When you walk from a brightly lit room to a dim one, you can’t see for a bit, but after a moment or two in the dark you can see just fine. The same is true when we experience other, slower adaptations.

Encourage yourself by remembering the restorative thing that’s happening at the cellular level. When you avoid overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure circuits, they become more numerous and more sensitive, giving the pleasures you experience greater variety and depth. You get more enjoyment from a handful of berries than you previously did from a glazed donut. You get pleasure not only from the natural sugars in the berries, but also from the multitude of subtle flavors. It’s like the difference between the blinding flash of a nightclub strobe light and the blues and pinks that attend the setting sun.

Call it what it is. We need a new name. Instead of dopamine fasting, we might call it dopamine revitalization. Not a puritanical condemnation of all forms of pleasure, but a way to reject the cudgel of crude stimulation in favor of a nuanced appreciation for the subtleties that make life richer. After years of needing more stimulation to get a good feeling, we’re re-regulating to need less. In this way we reorient ourselves to feel more. We regain what we have been missing: we make it easier to feel pleasure—easier to be happy. We increase our capacity for gratification and expand the host of things in which we can find pleasure.

RECLAIMING A DEEPER ENJOYMENT OF LIFE

Quick hits of dopamine stimulation from cell phones, Twinkies, and other easy boosts lead to elevated homeostatic tolerance, meaning we experience less and less pleasure from more and more stimulation. To make things worse, that reduced pleasure may increase cravings. The result is an obsessive pursuit that feels, and is, increasingly pointless.

Modern life sets us up for this. Our days are a string of dopaminergic stimulations followed immediately by mostly thoughtless responses. We don’t stop very often to reflect on why we’re chasing stimulation, nor do we pause enough in the sensory-rich here and now to enjoy what we’ve earned.

That leads to downregulation, and the need for more in order to feel less. But when we pull back from even a few well-chosen dopaminergic stimulations, we break the pattern. Instead of an unbroken string of demands and reactions, each day becomes a string of activities whose value, or lack of value, we more naturally come to recognize. This enhances our power to choose our responses. We can decide to spend less time anticipating things that we likely overvalue, and more time enjoying the undeniable reality of the pleasures of daily life.

We will still experience dissatisfaction. That’s not going away. We shouldn’t expect it to, nor should we hope it would. Being happy all the time is a problem all its own. And remember, it’s not the happy people who improve themselves or the world. But for someone with a revitalized dopamine system, there will be more appreciation from less dopamine stimulation, and more frequent and intense pleasure in the here and now. We feel more human.

Dopamine revitalization lowers our baseline tolerance, making it easier to feel dopamine stimulation. In the end, even a piece of toast can be more satisfying. We begin to experience richer gratification from everyday anticipations: settling in with a good book, looking forward to a healthy meal, catching an unexpected smile from a stranger. The spikes of H&N stimulation become more appreciated delights too: a homemade dessert, a glass of champagne at a party, or recognition for outstanding work. This kind of stimulation doesn’t lead us back down the dark path of needing more just to feel less. It restores the color and zest of life.

THE BLESSING OF A CHALLENGE

This won’t be easy. Do it anyway.

In Shakespeare’s play The Tempest, Prospero, the exiled duke of Milan, wants his daughter to marry the prince of Naples. He manages to bring them together and, sure enough, as soon as they meet, it’s love at first sight. But Prospero decides to make things difficult for the prince. He doesn’t want him to win his daughter too easily since that way he might not value her love. “Too light winning / Make the prize light,” he says.

The comedian-philosopher Rodney Douglas Norman recommended something similar in a poem called “I Hope You Have the Fortune to Experience Misfortune.”27 Rodney says that the best motivation is not difficulty but failure. “I hope you are neglected, ignored, and overlooked,” he writes, before wishing us further resistance against the dopamine lure of applause and acceptance: “I hope you learn that you don’t need others’ approval.”

The technological progress that makes our lives ever easier also makes us value lightly things that used to be precious. Rewards that once required hard work and perseverance can now be had by tapping a screen. Social media makes attention easy to find, and online shopping sites bring us by noon what we wanted only that morning. Even calories are cheap and plentiful. In the beginning, the biggest challenge humans faced was staying alive, but that’s over. Now gratification comes cheap, and those constant hits of dopamine are dulling our reward systems—dulling our minds, dulling our lives. Now we have to do something that evolution has not prepared us for: manage the ancient circuits in our brain so they don’t ruin our lives in pursuit not of survival but of overabundance and constant more. Saying no doesn’t come naturally, but in an age of so much plenty, a real challenge can be a gift.

Dopamine fasting may be a recent development, but the larger idea of the power of self-denial has been around for thousands of years. The Greek philosopher Epicurus wrote, “Be moderate in order to taste the joys of life in abundance.” He didn’t know about the dopamine system, but he understood the importance of maintaining sensitivity at large. It takes some discipline—we have to consciously oppose the evolutionary forces that shaped our brain circuits—but this kind of purposeful living can lead to the restoration of the joy we were made for.

* Although this study got a lot of attention, it was never peer reviewed or even published, so it should be taken with a huge grain of salt. Still, common sense tells us that smiling likely contributes to our happiness more than we realize.

DOPAMINE TOOLS THAT MIGHT BE

COMING SOON

TESTING, TESTING

Once you’ve worked to raise or lower dopamine and measured your success by assessing your feelings and behavior, you’ll probably wonder if there’s a way to measure those levels in terms of a number. The problem is that asking about your dopamine “level” oversimplifies what we need to know and what we can even measure—but this may change.

When we talk about medical tests, we’re often thinking of a blood test. Blood tests are reliably informative because the bloodstream is where so many important substances are found. But testing blood for dopamine won’t tell us much because dopamine levels matter most at the cellular level. For details of your dopamine activity, you’d have to explore the brain with “micron-scale electrodes” and ultrahigh-resolution observation.28 This has been done in experimental settings and that’s about it.

Yet in 2023, a team of five scientists from the disciplines of chemistry, neuropharmacology, and physiology documented their work toward measuring dopamine using a relatively new discovery, carbon quantum dots (CQDs). CQDs are among the tiniest things we know. How small are they? Comparing a CQD to the width of a human hair is like comparing a tennis ball to the length of two football fields. It turns out that when things are that small, the rules of physics get weird. Because of that, CQDs can be made to

light up, to deliver medicines to certain brain structures, and to react to certain molecules. They’re also fairly harmless in the body, so they’re ideal for brain research and the measurement of function—they are stable and “keep to themselves,” meaning they are largely resistant to whatever is around them. That means we can introduce them into the body without creating a problem—and since testing requires getting close to the thing you’re measuring, CQDs are a potentially powerful tool. In a carefully prepared environment, the radiation emitted by CQDs is proportional to the amount of dopamine around them. The important phrase here is “carefully prepared environment.” At this time, it would be nearly impossible to create such a setting in a medical office or even a hospital. Still, this could be a first step toward a precise test, enabling doctors to diagnose dopamine- based disorders at the molecular level.29

Another test of dopamine levels is already out there, but whether it works remains an open question. It is breathtakingly simple, and when I say simple, I do mean simple: it’s a dopamine scale based on a person’s eye- blink rate (EBR), calculated by nothing more than counting the number of spontaneous eye blinks per minute. A 2017 survey of the scientific literature on the method’s accuracy described it, at that point in time, as “inconsistent and incomplete.”30 Yet there does seem to be something to it, at least sometimes and for some people. Plus, the EBR test has helped in the development of another potential dopamine enhancer: a very unusual sound.

LISTEN TO THIS

Can we alter the effects of dopamine by slipping on a pair of headphones? In a 2013 paper, three scientists documented how they used EBR to measure dopamine levels while creating an “auditory illusion” known as binaural beats.31 The effects were encouraging.

To understand how we might change how we feel through sounds we hear, we first need to understand a bit about waves. Many things in nature carry wavelike qualities, including the repeated patterns of electrical activity in the neural tissue that makes up the brain. But to understand how waves affect the brain, let’s consider something we’re already familiar with

—waves in the ocean. There are many kinds of ocean waves, from rolling waves to gentle ripples. Rolling waves are large and slow. They carry a lot of energy and, over a short period, significantly affect the shape of a shoreline. Gentle ripples are small and fast. Their effect on the shore is slower and more subtle. Like ocean waves, brainwaves are associated with specific actions and outcomes.

Think of the frequency of waves as a pulse, like the beat of a song. For example, the Bee Gees’ “Stayin’ Alive” is about 104 beats per minute. Brainwaves have frequency, too, and each range of brainwave frequencies is associated with an activity or state of mind:

• Delta waves occur from once every 10 seconds up to 3.5 times every second (0.1–3.5 hertz, or Hz). These waves are associated with dreamless sleep and infancy. • Theta waves (3.5–7.5 Hz) are associated with creativity, fantasy, and intuition, as well as a lack of focus. • Alpha waves (8–12 Hz) are the most common state for the brain. They occur during simple, casual awareness. If you’re awake and not busy, you’re probably producing alpha waves. • Beta waves (12–30 Hz) are the next range up the scale. They occur when you’re occupied, making decisions, paying close attention, or thinking hard. • Gamma waves (30–44 Hz), the highest frequency commonly observed, are associated with simultaneous processing across multiple areas of the brain.

Now consider sound, which is a wave shape through a medium like air, repeated over and over. A gas engine in a car makes a sound at a somewhat low pitch, but when you rev it, that sound has a higher pitch. Why? The engine is making more RPMs, or revolutions per minute, and that higher frequency of activity creates a higher-pitched sound.

With all this in mind, we can examine a powerful oddity of brain function. If we play a pitch in one of your ears and a slightly lower pitch in the other, you will hear a pulse or “beat” with a frequency corresponding to the difference between the two notes. For instance, if one is the musical note C at 132 Hz, and the other is A at 78 Hz, you will hear* a beat that

occurs at the difference between them, 54 Hz.32 This brings us to a surprising outcome: Various frequencies of binaural beats appear to change the frequency of brainwaves and associated brain function, impacting mood, feeling, and cognition. All we have to do is precisely choose a pair of tones we listen to, one for each ear. The difference in frequency pushes our brainwaves to that frequency and stimulates related activities in various structures and systems.

One of the things we can stimulate this way is dopamine. The scientists behind the 2013 paper studied the effect of binaural beats by examining creativity. The result: Binaural beats seem to improve the brain’s ability to gather many different ideas in a relatively short time,33 a skill called “divergent thinking” that we’ll return to in chapter ten. This collecting of disparate elements, a particular kind of brainstorming, is the first step in purposeful creative thinking, because new ideas come from the connecting of otherwise unrelated things. In terms of the influence on dopamine, the results suggest that individuals with low dopamine benefit most from binaural beats and those with normal or high levels do not. Although, in another example of the brain resisting “overclocking,” members of the normal- and high-dopamine groups may hear binaural beats and experience decreased creative capacity.

How this works is unknown, but there’s something interesting going on. Binaural beats may someday help us be more creative when we have a deficiency of dopamine activity in that related part of the brain. There may even be a future in using auditory stimulation to affect dopamine levels to affect mood, feeling, and cognition. It’s likely a long way away, but the results so far are intriguing.

IN SEARCH OF THE EASIER WORKOUT

We would all like to feel more motivated. Here’s how we may someday achieve this via dopamine.

Manipulating microbiomes in mice can boost dopamine activity and motivate them to exercise. We also know that human beings with relatively high dopamine levels are generally more willing to exercise—but that’s true only when there’s a reward in front of them.

Is it possible for dopamine to motivate us—in this case, to exercise — without the offer of a reward?

Researchers began with nineteen volunteers already diagnosed with low dopamine because of Parkinson’s disease and followed them through three experiments. Some days the subjects took their usual dopamine replacement. Other days they were told to skip the medicine. Over several days, researchers directed the subjects to squeeze a hand grip that measured the pressure exerted.

Experiment 1

Researchers asked the test subjects to squeeze the hand grip and rate the difficulty.

Results: When the subjects took their medicine to normalize dopamine levels, they accurately reported the resistance of the device. When they didn’t take the medicine and had low dopamine, they overstated the resistance.

Conclusion: When dopamine levels are below normal, a physical task might be anticipated as more difficult than it really is. That could discourage you from attempting it.

Experiment 2

In the second experiment, researchers had some patients take their dopamine-restoring medicine and had others skip it. They then gave the subjects a choice:

• Option 1: Squeeze a grip that is guaranteed to be easy. • Option 2: Flip a coin. Heads, squeeze a grip that requires no effort at all. Tails, squeeze a grip that will require more effort than usual.

Results: Subjects with normal dopamine levels were more likely to take a chance on the coin flip and risk the tougher task. Those with low dopamine were more likely to take the easy option.

Conclusion: When dopamine levels are below normal, you may have less confidence in your ability to complete a physical task, so you are less likely to attempt it.

Experiment 3

In the third experiment, researchers gave participants a choice:

• Option 1: Accept a small amount of money and be relieved of participating in a physical task. • Option 2: Flip a coin. Heads, you get no money. Tails, you get more than the Option 1 amount.

Results: There was no difference in the responses between the medicated and nonmedicated groups.

Conclusion: The influence of dopamine on increasing confidence appears to be specific to physical activity.34 It does not seem to have an effect on generalized confidence or nonphysical risk.

This and similar experiments suggest that someday there may be a dopamine-related treatment that could make us perceive a workout (or some other demanding task) to be less exhausting than it is, and thus make us more inclined to exercise. That would be a valuable bit of motivation for a world in which obesity and the sedentary lifestyle are so common and costly.*

CREATIVITY VIA THE WALL SOCKET

Technology gives us the ability to do all sorts of things faster and easier than we used to. Calculators and computers enable us to perform complex calculations that would take much longer by hand. AI can produce a time- saving summary of anything from an email thread to an entire book. Might there be a technology to boost our creativity too?

Recent work suggests that such an outcome may be possible, even imminent. It also may spare us the downsides that typically come with

treatments that “overclock” an otherwise normal brain. There are already several ways to stimulate the brain into improved performance by using electricity. The most well-known is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or electric shock therapy, used for treatment-resistant depression. Another is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which is similar to ECT except, instead of routing electric current directly through the brain, it uses a magnetic field to create more subdued currents. But the brain stimulation technology we’re interested in is so new that it has been investigated only minimally.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a more precise tool than ECT or TMS, and it seems to do via electrical stimulation what we can now do only via medication. For instance, Xanax has a sedative effect by stimulating the release of GABA, a neurotransmitter that blocks certain stress-making signals in your brain. tDCS does the same thing but with electricity* instead of neurochemistry, though the effect isn’t as strong as medications. The method is noninvasive. By carefully positioning electrodes on our head, we can choose the structures we want to stimulate.

What if we could boost creativity by using tDCS to inhibit the control dopamine circuit? That would be useful, since the circuit blocks odd or seemingly unreasonable ideas, which are often useful when we’re pursuing new approaches and fresh designs. The control circuit involves the prefrontal cortex, which is right behind the forehead, making it the only element of the control system we can reach with tDCS stimulation. Scientists placed a negative electrode over this area, hoping to inhibit the control circuit and make it easier for odd ideas to get through to the desire circuit, home of creative thinking. In an experiment, volunteers stimulated in this way were able to come up with more alternative uses for everyday objects than those who were not stimulated. In fact, in the estimation of the experimenters, the subjects’ ideas were especially odd or uncommon.35 The experimenters equated this with a boost in creativity. Normal ideas still came through, too, because they weren’t being blocked in the first place. This matters because we don’t want to shift our creative efforts to only the production of nutty ideas. (We’d like only a sprinkling of such nuts.)

At this time, tDCS isn’t being used on patients. It’s just a research tool to manipulate the brain in interesting ways to see what happens. However, it

uses a fairly simple technology, and at the time of publication you could buy a tDCS device on Amazon. Some graduating students presented one as a gift to my friend and partner on The Molecule of More, Dan Lieberman. He has it on display in his office but he hasn’t been brave (or foolish) enough yet to strap it on. I have asked him to let me know when he does, as it could make for a fun afternoon.

It’s reasonable to believe that a version of this technology for boosting creativity is in our future. It’s probably just a matter of time, testing, and a little more research—plus finding someone to test it.

WHAT IF IT COULD GIVE YOU BACK YOUR LIFE?

Many dopamine-related treatments now in use deliver their benefits at the expense of our ability to enjoy some of the simplest pleasures of life. For instance, many antidepressants have unwanted sexual side effects.

What if we could fix that? There’s a compound under study right now that might get us there, though the details sound less like medical research and more like the origin story from a superhero movie.

Here’s a fact not widely discussed outside of pharmacological research: many drugs start out as poison. Penicillin, as you’ve likely heard, comes from mold—something you don’t want to ingest. Another example: Nearly a hundred years ago, veterinarians noticed that injured cattle chose to eat a certain clover. Usually, eating the clover killed them. When they were sick, it helped them. An extract from the plant proved to have a medicinal use in humans and became the blood thinner warfarin.36 Lithium, one of the first breakthrough psychiatric medications of the twentieth century, was developed by Australian psychiatrist John Cade. He figured out its power by working with an extensive collection of his patients’ urine.37 (He kept the jars in his refrigerator. The next time you think your fridge is toxic, think of Dr. Cade’s kitchen.)

The latest example of this age-old story features beta-carbolines, implicated in Parkinson’s disease. In high concentrations they can attack the dopamine system by tearing it apart, neuron by neuron. But if we slightly modify a beta-carboline,* something surprising happens: it switches from

destroying dopamine neurons to protecting them, creating what two Russian neuroscientists characterized as “good guys from a shady family.”38 The rehabilitated neurons improve oxygen use by the targeted cells, ultimately promoting the creation of more dopamine. The restored cells also survive better under stressful conditions, proliferate more easily, and make better connections to other cells. The end result is improved function for the patient.

As we’ve seen, fooling around with the dopamine system can have bad effects too. Lab tests with these modified beta-carbolines in animals have shown improved learning and faster adjustment to new environments, but that’s no guarantee for what might happen with humans, and there don’t seem to have been any human studies so far. But that doesn’t mean people aren’t trying it anyway. Since this approach is not yet regulated by the FDA, the general public can do with it what they like,† and some of them have. The results are intriguing. Here’s how one user described it:

[This molecule] was what I used after I felt years of ADHD medication had made it difficult to feel natural world stimuli, and it worked within a few days. I was out enjoying sports again and basic socialization. [It’s a] subjective perspective but a lot of these anecdotes [are] online in that community.

The effects maximize within the first week and stabilize thereafter. It’s not a “high” and only feels mildly stimulating. But you begin to enjoy simple things like walking outdoors in the sun all over again or seeing a colourful plant. The effect did not wear off; it just became my new normal so to speak. Even years later.39

In some ways the current evidence for this kind of treatment is similar to that available for nutritional supplements, whose claims rely on animal studies, anecdotal reports, and not much more. But setting aside the need for a greater sample size, the animal studies are credible, starting with the fact that they were performed by individuals with no financial interest in the outcome. As for users’ comments, they’re looking for help, some of them desperately. If the compound didn’t help, they had no reason to say

otherwise. In fact, they would have had every reason to talk down the drug, having been let down yet again.

Does that mean people who want to reinvigorate their dopamine circuits should take it? We don’t actually know that it works, or if it’s safe. We’ve seen cognitive improvements at low doses in animals, but at higher doses it has triggered anxiety behaviors and seizures. People who didn’t harm themselves permanently by taking it may have just been lucky, and those who really did feel better may have just gotten very lucky—or maybe they’re the first users of what will turn out to be a miracle drug. Either way, who it can help, how much it can help, and why, if it does at all, is a roll of the dice just now, and dosage is a guess. Except for the terribly desperate, the risks far outweigh the possible benefits. But inside the lab, and in well- controlled human trials, this is a promising path of study, and scientists want nothing more than to make it work so people can get some relief. Stand by.

THE REPLACEMENTS

There’s one thing that would be better than introducing outside-sourced dopamine to a brain that doesn’t produce enough: restoring the brain’s ability to create it. We could, in theory, transplant precursor neurons into the brain, which would develop into complete cells, start making dopamine, and then keep doing it as if they’d been there all along. These kinds of implants have been the distant dream of doctors for nearly three decades, conceived after the first isolation of embryonic stem cells that could, in principle, do the job. There’s been little progress because the work is wildly complicated, it’s bound up in ethical questions and international legal coordination, and it’s risky to the test subjects. But a group of researchers led by Claire Henchcliffe, a neurologist at the University of California, Irvine, seems to have taken the first step toward a practical treatment. If progress continues, it could lead to the most powerful curative in the history of brain science and the restoration of normal lives for millions with brain injuries and diseases, including Parkinson’s.

The front-and-center issue is safety. When implanting these cells in humans goes wrong, it can go very wrong. One test in the year 2000 was

“nightmarish”: the newly implanted cells went wild and could not be turned off. Younger Parkinson’s patients experienced horrifying symptoms such as constant chewing, flailing fingers, and arms flinging about. “It was tragic, catastrophic,” said Dr. Paul E. Green, one of the researchers in the study.40

Twenty years later, Dr. Henchcliffe’s work directly addressed this problem. After animal studies showed excellent safety and tolerability, Henchcliffe’s team received permission to proceed to a first-in-human study. In a small test of twelve people with Parkinson’s disease, the team implanted lab-made neurons that produce dopamine, whose shortage is key to the condition. Not only did the new cells produce replacement dopamine, they seem to have become a working part of the brain, staying active for about eighteen months so far, as of March 2024.41 These implants, a treatment known as MSK-DA01, “appear to be safe and may have reduced symptoms” for some participants.42 This is the promise of regenerative medicine: instead of patching the problem, working around it, or creating a substitute, the brain literally acquires a fresh version of the structure that failed. It’s the difference between, for example, attaching a prosthetic limb and growing a new one. The CEO of the company behind the effort said, “There is a day when we hope that people don’t think of themselves as Parkinson’s patients.”43

The Henchcliffe study was a phase I trial, which means it was not about efficacy but about safety, side effects, and dosing. A phase II trial will produce hard data on whether the treatment really works. If that effort is promising, a larger phase III trial will compare the outcomes to those of current treatments. If the new treatment appears to be superior, the last step will be applying to the FDA for approval. This work is very preliminary and there’s a lot of effort ahead, but it’s promising. But if the treatment works, it could be a path to supplementing or replacing neurons in other dopamine systems in the brain.

THE END OF ADDICTION?

Some conditions we can cure by eliminating the problem wholesale. Malaria responds to artemisinin* drugs. Cholera is solved with antibiotics

and rehydration. A couple of aspirin often fix a headache. Other conditions can’t be made to disappear, but we can end their harmful effects permanently with simple, ongoing treatment, such as diuretics for high blood pressure or hormone therapy for hypothyroidism.

What if dopamine-driven cravings and urges could be made to go away too? What if we could end addiction?

In modern medicine no one is cured of addiction. People acquire ways to diminish the worst of the urge, then learn to manage what remains. That’s an excellent outcome but it’s not the same as a cure. The problem is bound up with emotion, mood, and craving, which are just as often part of pleasant things. To “cure” addiction we’d need a compound that not only targeted particular aspects of the human experience but also had an effect only in certain situations. In particular, we’d need to tame cravings, which dopamine helps cause. With overindulgence over time, pleasure fades but craving does not—that’s the power of addiction. But on that fact hangs a potential solution.

Semaglutide is the key ingredient in brand-name medications including Ozempic, Rybelsus, and Wegovy. The original use of semaglutide was to treat type 2 diabetes, which comprises about 90% of diabetes cases. Semaglutide helps control blood sugar levels. That’s what counts in diabetes treatment, but it does a couple other things too. It slows the movement of food through the stomach and decreases the desire for food. The result of this has been not only better diabetes management but also weight loss. This side effect appeared in pretty much anybody who took it, diabetic or not. They didn’t even have to try that hard to cut back on what they ate. They naturally ate less. That’s the key to the success of semaglutide: it makes the craving for food decline to nearly nothing. Already, some businesses are adjusting their plans to account for how semaglutide may change culture and commerce—for instance, Weight Watchers is shutting many physical locations, apparently in part because of this new approach to diet and lifestyle. That’s a big deal. But even bigger is that these new weight-loss drugs may have historic implications for addiction at large.44 This experience of “the end of craving” can be profound, and I have not had to look far for an example.

I’ve battled obesity most of my adult life. I’ve lost weight but always with great struggle. My problem is simple and if not a true addiction then reminiscent of it: I crave the experience of eating. I can be full and still enjoy it. If someone asked me if I wanted to order a pizza, my answer was always yes. I don’t recall considering if I was hungry. I like the way it feels to eat. I like the flavor of food. I like the experience of eating. I have declined weight loss surgery because it limits forever the ability to indulge in this thing I love. Not be able to tuck into an extravagant meal anymore? Ask if I’d like to give up breathing.

When I became a semaglutide patient, the drug diminished not just my appetite, a result which I anticipated, but also my craving for food, which I did not. I was told this would happen; I just couldn’t imagine such a thing could be real. But it was—and it was amazing. Then came an even bigger surprise: it also took away my desire for the pleasure of eating—the infinitely satisfying H&N act of consuming something delicious. Imagine forgetting someone you were in love with. It happens. But imagine not caring if you ever fall in love again. This, unbelievably, was like that.

I gave myself my first injection on a Monday at 9 AM. Three hours later I attended a business lunch at an Italian restaurant that I love—a new one, so there was still a lot of dopaminergic anticipation attached to it for me. I’d barely worked through the menu! Yet not only did I lack an appetite, the food didn’t appeal to me at all. Just to have something in front of me while taking up a table, I ordered a side dish and picked at it. It’s been like that ever since: Food? Nah. Not much interested.

The drug makes me feel full all the time, but feeling full had never before stopped me from eating. The difference has been that I no longer crave food. Ask me now if I want a pizza and I’ll tell you no, I don’t. The desire is just . . . gone. The intense pleasure of eating? That’s gone too. Things still taste good, but the absolute urge that will not be denied—that drag-you-by-the-neck demand to eat? It’s evaporated.

Your rapidly slimming correspondent is not alone in this experience, and for many, this decrease in desire extends to more than just food. There are reports across Great Britain, for instance, of semaglutide users experiencing a decline in far more insidious cravings, such as those that come from the chemical addiction to cigarettes and alcohol, and behaviors

such as nail biting, skin picking, and compulsive shopping.45 Here’s why that may be happening.

The connection between dopamine and craving begins at the pancreas.*

Semaglutide causes the pancreas to release insulin over a long period. Similar agents such as liraglutide and exenatide act over shorter periods. All of them do this by stimulating a receptor for the hormone GLP-1, which stands for glucagon-like peptide-1. A compound that stimulates a receptor is called an agonist, hence these compounds are “GLP-1 agonists.” In addition to stimulating the release of insulin, these agonists ultimately cause action along the dopamine-reward pathway. This is where the promising effects begin: studies from 2018 to 2020 on rats and mice showed GLP-1 drugs had a mediating effect on dopamine stimulation from alcohol,46 cocaine,47 and oxycodone.48 Another study found semaglutide “promoted the growth of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra” in mice.49

It’s a long way from laboratory studies in animals to safe and effective treatments in humans, but the search is underway. Much of semaglutide’s method of action is unclear. Perhaps it ultimately creates some inhibition in a precise part of the dopamine system, the part we associate with cravings. That’s a very general description, like saying, “Perhaps we can sail to Europe because this boat tends to float,” but it’s a place to start. There are many moving parts to explore. Semaglutide may work by increasing the number of dopamine receptors, which could diminish compulsion or addiction because such a system is more easily satisfied. Then again, more receptors could instead drive increased compulsive behavior since the pleasure from stimulation may be greater. We also know that otherwise similar receptors and neurons in any such system can yield wildly different effects depending on where they are located. For example, the chocolate- chip-sized nucleus accumbens is where dopamine is released in the desire circuit. When dopamine is released in the shell of the nucleus accumbens, the feeling is reward; when dopamine is released in its core, the feeling is craving.

We know only this for sure: if semaglutide and other GLP-1 agonists’ very promising effects on addictive behavior can be associated with particular actions at the cellular level, it may lead to an effective and

profound treatment for chemical and behavioral addictions and compulsive behavior. That would be a dopamine effect to transform the world.

* Sometimes the beat is too low frequency to consciously hear. The brain still senses it, though, and reacts. * There’s still no research toward making a workout fun, though my gym has free bottled water and really big TVs, so there’s that. * A receptor has a positive or negative charge relative to the fluid it sits in. Introducing electricity into this environment changes that charge, and the charge is what determines whether a neuron fires. It’s all very interesting if you’re into that sort of thing, but you don’t have to understand these details to get the point I’m making here. * We shift a carbon atom from one position to another in the molecule; again, you don’t need to know this to understand what’s going on but I include it for completeness. † You’ll notice I have not identified the compound. It’s legal to experiment with it outside the lab but the risks are profound. * What’s artemisinin, you ask? Why, it’s no more than a sesquiterpene lactone molecule containing an unusual peroxide bridge. Or in plain language, it’s a Chinese herb that seems to have antiparasitic properties. * This explains why the potential wonder drug grew out of diabetes research.

### Chapter 5: Raising and Lowering Dopamine Through Therapy

TALK, LISTEN, CHANGE, IMPROVE

If you want to change the overall effects of dopamine in your life, yet another path is possible: therapy. Consider focusing less on understanding the neuroscience of dopamine and more on working with your feelings and behaviors—a more traditional way to build the mindset you seek and a life closer to what you’d like it to be. Therapy is powerful and proven. Whether you’re dealing with too much dopamine activity, not enough, or, more likely, issues that are more subtly involved with dopamine and its interplay with other systems, therapy relieves you of having to understand brain chemistry and allows you to focus directly on mind, mood, attitude, behavior, and choice.

For those willing to put in significant effort—to treat it like a job with value in both the work along the way and the goal at the end—therapy can be a peerless exercise to improve life. But you have to commit to it the way you do to your family or a career you love. Therapy can make your life better on all fronts: your approach to problems, the way you accommodate disappointment, how you manage urges, how you treat other people, and the way you make decisions. Engaged therapeutic intervention can be the path to finding satisfaction and meaning in life. It’s that useful.

For people who are especially self-disciplined, some therapeutic methods can work as a self-directed effort, no therapist needed. This underlines the fact that therapy is more than a conversation. Within a framework of guidance derived from science and philosophy, it is engagement with yourself toward a frank consideration of who you are and who you want to be.

Talking is a part of therapy but it’s not the only part. There has to be more. Simply talking about a serious problem with behavior, mood, and outlook is about as impactful as talking about a broken arm. The work must go deeper, such as defining what qualifies as a problem; identifying what is and is not a problem for you in particular; and reckoning, sometimes in uncomfortable ways, with why you have certain feelings and engage in certain behaviors. Therapy requires training oneself to accommodate discomfort. This lets us better estimate how much of what we feel is a response to real threat and how much is only ingrained reaction to stimulation. Finally, therapy requires us to take action toward improvement, which can also be uncomfortable and even frightening. Therapy is a multifront effort to improve how we feel, behave, react, and conduct ourselves. It must have a goal, it must be built on a method or theory, and it must result in regular progress. Therapy is improvement made manifest by action.

The most commonly used therapeutic method just now is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). It is the most researched and studied form of psychotherapy, its outcomes tested in quantitative terms against objective standards. Most important, its results are typically more positive than those of other approaches.50 CBT aligns with current consensus on both how the brain works physically (neuroscience) and why we feel and behave the way we do (psychology). It’s not perfect and it’s not complete, but there are a lot of people living more successful, more satisfying lives today because they pursued CBT and stuck with it. Practitioners and experts will argue about details of its method, but what matters to you is whether it can help, and it absolutely can. CBT, often in combination with medication, can provide relief from many common, troubling psychiatric issues, including dopamine-related problems such as depression, panic, anxiety, phobia,

bipolar disorder, bulimia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.

You can pursue CBT on your own, but a self-directed approach is not for every person or every condition. If you’re severely depressed to the point that you don’t go out and you’re missing work, trying CBT by yourself is probably too heavy a lift. But if you have mild to moderate symptoms of depression or anxiety, or you can clearly identify the behaviors and feelings you want to change (and they’re not profoundly preventing you from living life), you can likely find a lot of help in a CBT- based book or online program.51

To practice CBT, you’re going to undertake a methodical examination of how you think and feel. From the understanding you gain, you’ll propose connections between the things you believe and why you believe them, which will help you decide whether what you believe is worth holding on to. You’ll practice identifying and classifying your thoughts. You’ll seek (and find) connections between those thoughts and the feelings that accompany them. One of the most helpful things you’ll do is test those thoughts against reality, then practice replacing false ideas with true ones.

Here’s a way to do that, and an easy way to remember: call it “possibility versus probability.” For example, a common troubling thought is that someone who is late for an appointment with you has been in an accident. While that’s possible, it’s more likely they have been held up for a benign reason. Consider how often accidents happen versus harmless delays. What’s more likely?

Another example: You feel that your lack of success at something is because you have bad luck. In fact, you can probably examine your behavior and circumstances to identify concrete causes for your lack of success as well as ways to improve the situation.

For those seeking a more personalized approach to taming the challenge of dopamine, engaging with a reputable therapist is a great choice. In the wake of the pandemic and the rise of remote meetings with medical practitioners, more therapists are available than ever, often at a lower price than they used to be. An engaged professional can answer your questions and guide you through your self-inquiry. They’ll also act as an

accountability partner, further guaranteeing that you’ll seriously engage with the hard work that success at CBT requires.

While understanding the role of dopamine in the challenges you face will help you get more out of all this, that’s not because therapy depends on your understanding of neuroscience. It’s because that knowledge will have given you a head start on serious thought about your urges and motivations. Dopamine is at the heart of desire, urge, reward, and pleasure—and CBT provides a path to gaining better control over them.

ACCEPTANCE AND COMMITMENT

“There’s no such thing as bad weather, only the wrong clothing.”52

Billy Connolly, comedian

CBT is built on the idea that if you understand the reasons for your thinking and behavior, you’ll be better able to change them. Traditional behavior therapy is built on the idea that all behaviors are learned, so we can change them by learning something else without examining our underlying motivations. Both have a sound record of success, though CBT is far more widely used.53 But another approach is gaining ground, one that, as Billy Connolly observes, is more about changing our reaction than our situation.

In the 1980s, Steven C. Hayes, a professor of psychology at the University of Nevada, Reno, proposed what he called Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT, pronounced as the word act). ACT incorporates elements of CBT and traditional behavior therapy. However, instead of identifying troubling thoughts and feelings, then helping patients understand their source and acquire the tools to eliminate them, ACT directs us to accept that certain kinds of troubling feelings are a part of a healthy emotional landscape, and that in many situations our discomfort with them is natural. Therefore we will be better off learning to accept them, the better to pursue our lives.54

This is an especially valuable approach for feelings that arise from dopamine. Why? We could not function without dopamine-driven motivation, even though the price of it often includes difficulty and pain.

Attempts to rid ourselves of dopaminergic motivation will be doomed to fail, because dopaminergic motivation is key to many things that aren’t problematic at all and are necessary to life. ACT reorients our minds around the idea that not every discomfort is best eliminated. Some discomforts, including many that are dopamine driven, are a part of the yin and yang of life. ACT gives us a way to act on this truth and make progress.

Let’s say I buy a house with a huge pole in the middle of the basement. This pole prevents me from using the space for a game room. I have several choices:

• I figure out why the pole is there. Maybe it’s a supporting pole that holds up the house. Maybe it used to be a supporting pole but isn’t needed anymore. Maybe it’s decorative. Or maybe it’s something I have yet to think of. Whatever it is, I’ll have to work with an engineer or at least a carpenter to figure it out. It’ll take time and resources to do so, but with this knowledge I may find a way to get rid of the pole, though I might not. • I get rid of the pole without investigating why it’s there. This may work out or it may not. I may get the game room I wanted, no problem, or I may get it for a while only to end up with related problems later, like the living room collapsing onto my new pool table. • I accept that the pole is a part of the room. I see that it was part of the necessary structure of the house. I look for ways to work around it. This has the advantage of allowing me to begin using the space sooner rather than later, although I may not get to use it in the way I originally planned.

The first option is like CBT: let’s take the time to figure out why the problem exists, then act on that knowledge. The second is like traditional behavioral therapy: I don’t want to spend time and effort figuring out why it’s there. It’s possible we won’t figure it out anyway, so let’s just get rid of the barrier and move on—and accept that we may encounter unintended consequences. The third is ACT: the pole is a part of an immutable landscape. Let’s choose to accept that and live accordingly. If we do that

well, in time we may no longer notice the problem. We may not even see it as a problem.

ACT has unique and practical qualities that make it attractive to those taking on dopamine-driven problems. What recommends it most is its direct focus on helping people feel better right away: ACT turns our attention immediately to improving our state of mind by modifying how we behave. There’s no waiting while we engage in deep self-examination to identify some troubling experience and untangle it from our behavior. CBT requires us to identify and reject ideas that influence our lives. While that’s a powerful approach, it can take a lot of time. ACT builds upon our existing mindset to directly move us toward our desired outcome.

ACT isn’t for everybody. It requires learning to live with discomfort that you may believe is the fault of others. Some people can’t do that. They may be better off with CBT or behavioral therapy, both of which take a problem–solution approach that begins at the source of the trouble. ACT starts from the perspective that life is an experience of many kinds of feelings, not all of which are pleasant, and that accepting this variety is key to finding greater satisfaction and meaning, and more day-to-day happiness.

Why do we prioritize digging into problems, sometimes seeking to place blame over finding relief? Here’s one theory. Technology creates progress by asking us to identify a problem, then to derive a solution. This approach is now so ubiquitous that it has been stretched beyond where it works into places where it may not, such as the mind. Many of us now think of every discomfort as a problem in need of a solution—a new idea that draws us toward perpetual conflict with others and ourselves.

“[W]ith every scientific and technological advance, a discrepancy-based mode of mind grows stronger, and our ability to be present, aware, and flexible grows weaker,” Dr. Hayes wrote in 2009. “Yet we as a culture seem to be dedicated to the idea that ‘negative’ human emotions need to be fixed, managed, or changed—not experienced as part of a whole life. We are treating our lives as problems to be solved, as if we can sort through our experiences for the ones we like and throw out the rest.”55 ACT promises a faster way through the challenge to reach the richer life that results. While it requires us to accommodate difficulties, the benefit of this is typically a more fulfilling experience of emotions and perspectives, greater empathy,

and a deeper tolerance for our own shortcomings and those we see in others. ACT steers us toward finding meaning in all experience, and away from elevating pleasure and comfort above all. It shows us that a satisfying life is built on more than delight, just as a healthy diet is built on more than what is sweet.

ACT: SIX SKILLS

ACT is built on six skills that promote psychological flexibility in experiencing, processing, planning, and reacting. As with physical flexibility, we build these capacities through practice and (mental) exercise. Some steps promote fluency in how we deal with anticipation. The others promote our appreciation of the here and now. Taken together, they build harmony between our accommodation of what we feel today and our desire for what we want in the future. They can guide us to achieve the balance we need to constructively address dopamine-driven problems.

Skill One is Acceptance. When I was an undergraduate student in physics, the first thing my instructors taught me was to inventory all the facts at hand without regard to my opinion of them or their apparent utility. That’s what we do in this step: we strive to become aware of what we are feeling, the better to know ourselves fully and without bias. We acknowledge difficult feelings as well as pleasure. We recognize when we’re denying feelings, masking them, or avoiding them. In this way we begin to teach ourselves to experience the world as it is so we can build the internal life we want.

Skill Two is Cognitive Defusion. You need to be able to separate or defuse feelings from your reaction to them. This demands self-awareness in uncomfortable, even painful moments, and it does not come naturally. Yet learning how to do this will give you the ability to reject being consumed by fear in favor of consciously and purposefully choosing how you will respond.

Let’s say you’re driving down the road when a terrible storm sets in. Your first reaction is pure feeling: It’s hard to drive. The road is slick, and I can’t see very well. I’m getting nervous, and that’s making this even more difficult. But in a moment another thought may occur to you, a thought that

is not feeling but considered reflection: This is a rainstorm. Rain makes the road slick, so my reflexes need to be as good as the situation requires. Based on this assessment, you may decide to slow down, pull over, or continue to drive, just with more caution.

Intense feeling is a natural response to stress but it doesn’t have to be the basis for reaction. Instead of fusing the experience of the rain with our reaction to it, we can separate or defuse them. The rain is stimulus. What we do in response is our reaction. Let’s put a gap between them: we experience the feeling, then pause to remember that we can reject immediate, unconsidered reaction. Now we’ve improved things for ourselves. First, we’ve given ourselves time to practice cooler, more useful observation. Then we’ve better equipped ourselves to come up with a thoughtful response. Cognitive defusion creates a space for a back and forth between here-and-now processing at the time of stimulation, and the dopamine- driven capacity for calculation.

Skill Three is Performing as the Observing Self. This is what’s going on in the time between experiencing some stimulation (The highway is slick!) and taking some considered action because of it (Slow down!). That purposeful response is made by the observing self.

It may be the result of simple reasoning, such as deciding to slow down on that wet highway. That’s an improvement over thoughtless response. But in the face of some challenges, the process may be deeper and more personal. In those cases, we process emotions and facts, create possible courses of action, then, by way of mental time travel, evaluate the possible results. We then consider all that in light of the self-image to which we aspire. Finally, we make a choice that comports with who we are and who we wish to be.

Let’s say I’m talking with someone about politics, and they’ve shifted from matters of policy to a barrage of personal insults. Let’s further stipulate that I’ve become pretty good lately at defusing stimulus from reaction, and letting the observing self do its work in the time between—in a moment of stress, I have the ability to distance myself from my emotions and choose a more considered reaction. I factor in the facts, my true feelings, and how various reactions comport with whom I consider myself to be.

If my “list” of self-beliefs is I’m an open-minded person, I’m pretty patient, and I like to learn new things, I may ignore the insults, challenge my friend’s way of arguing, or ask him to stop. I might also decide that there are exceptions to when I act on these self-beliefs and instead just walk away. Or I might be led to an entirely different reaction. How tightly or loosely we hold to our self-beliefs is a measure of how easily we can change—for better or for worse.

Whatever I choose, the work of the observing self is almost always superior to simply reacting. We make better choices when we favor our analysis of emotion over the emotion itself. Call it the satisfaction of self- control. The observing self lets us weigh desires about the future against what feels pressing in the present. It’s an exercise in productively using the best of our dopamine-related qualities in concert with how we feel in the here and now.

Skill Four is Living in the Present. Not to be confused with recognizing feelings as feelings and processing them from some mental remove, this skill refers to what some call mindfulness. Here, I refer to the ability to focus on and feel an experience as it occurs, as opposed to dimming the here and now in favor of a memory of the past, or leaning on our dopaminergic nature to escape the stress of the present in favor of imagining some more pleasant possibility in the future.

This is easier in some situations than in others. When you’re having good sex, you’re pretty much focused on the here and now without having to try. Other experiences require us to make a significant effort. Even the most committed parent will find it difficult to keep paying attention in the second hour of your kid’s junior high choir concert. But by making the effort to experience with our senses what’s happening around us, we condition ourselves to become more naturally observant, which better equips us to make decisions about how we wish to react in the moment and live overall. It also gives us the best thing of all: a stronger ability to savor the ineffable qualities that define the experience of being aware and alive.

The last two skills are primarily centered on dopamine-dependent planning.

Skill Five is Value Identification. When we are direct with ourselves about what our values are, we are more likely to align our day-to-day living with our self-conception. That will bring us greater satisfaction with life and

lead to more consistent and satisfying feelings and outcomes. Think of value identification as our aspirational side: we may not always live according to our best intentions, but we more or less know what we’re aiming for. This is the most dopamine dependent skill of the six: it requires us to manipulate abstractions, imagine various situations in the future, and calculate potential outcomes based on often elaborate models of what might be.

Skill Six is Committed Action. If value identification is a way to point yourself in the direction you wish to go, committed action is what you do to get there. The time for thinking and planning is over. Now it’s time for doing things—carrying out your intentions based on the dopamine-driven planning and calculation you worked on before. It is only in this step that you transform those imagined plans into reality. It is also at this step of ACT that highly dopaminergic people may be tempted to rework their plans instead of carrying them out; therefore it’s a good time to remember that progress doesn’t occur if you let the perfect be the enemy of the good. It’s better to take action and adjust your course along the way than to second- guess yourself based on new ideas and information. Better to modify your plan as necessary while you’re doing things than to put off getting started.

The goals of ACT and these six skills are to (1) free us from purely reactive behavior, (2) equip us with greater capacity to accommodate barriers that may not be surmountable, and (3) set us on a path of action to reach our goals. In this way we live more closely, and more intentionally, in harmony with the intentions we have for our lives.

A BIGGER IDEA BEHIND IT ALL

There’s one more therapeutic philosophy that’s worth considering here: logotherapy, from the Greek logos, referring to “meaning.” Logotherapy was conceived in the 1940s by Austrian psychiatrist Viktor Frankl, who asserted that our primary motivation is the need for meaning. Frankl’s ideas constitute a therapeutic method and framework by themselves, but they are more often used as an additional layer to enrich other methods. Frankl’s ideas can especially enhance ACT, which directs us toward changing the

things we can change, most of which are within ourselves, and accepting what we cannot.

Sigmund Freud said we are motivated by the will to seek pleasure. His contemporary, Alfred Adler, who is less well-known but who has had more influence than Freud on modern therapies such as CBT, said we are motived by the will to secure power—the need to overcome feelings of weakness against forces in the world and in ourselves. As these ideas were becoming intellectual pillars of the twentieth century, Frankl proposed something else. On his release from a Holocaust death camp, he reflected on his medical and psychological training in light of his experience there, and on the outlook he and others employed to survive. This led him to an insight on human nature that many consider as vital as the central ideas of Freud or Adler toward a complete portrait of human motivation. Frankl said we are primarily motivated not by pleasure or power but by an innate will to attach meaning to our lives. The addition of Frankl’s ideas can be highly effective in informing treatment.

For those independent enough to recognize the value of Frankl during an intellectual era in which Freud held spectacular sway, logotherapy offered a profound advance in therapeutic approach. In particular, he connected an analytical view of the mind with rational valuation of the human tendency toward spirituality and religion.

Frankl widened the path for helping people feel better. If you consider what you know about dopamine, you’ll understand why. Freud and Adler believed that we are motivated to pursue things that can never be completely possessed: the stimulation of pleasure and the security of control. We achieve them by attempting to conquer elements of the world— a dopaminergic pursuit that inevitably returns us to a state of discontent. Frankl believed we are motivated by the will to meaning, which lies not simply at the end of dopaminergic pursuit but all along the way.

That’s a huge idea with deep potential: we are motivated by the will to meaning, which lies not at the end of dopaminergic pursuit but all along the way.

By recognizing that this is how the mind works, we might holistically accommodate and even roll back much of the distress that comes with being alive, including the dissatisfaction that follows the dopaminergic urge. Frankl recognized that what you and I call the “dopamine chase” is never

going to provide satisfaction. He quoted Nietzsche’s Twilight of the Idols: “he who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.”

The search for meaning is not a way to distract us from gazing into the void. It provides a way to acknowledge the void and navigate our lives anyway. With that in mind, the therapist’s job becomes helping the patient work through the overriding question, What is the meaning to your life?

Frankl stressed that the therapist has no right to dictate meaning—it’s impossible anyway, he said, since meaning is individualistic, subjective, and re-evaluated over time. A painter, he said, shows us their view of the world—and a therapist shouldn’t be like a painter. A therapist’s task is more like that of an eye doctor, who wants us to see the world as it is. Logotherapy shows us a way to find achievement in the experience of suffering, and suffering is what brings many to therapy in the first place. Logotherapy helps us find a reason to take constructive action even though life is finite. And it uses our sense of guilt to help us recognize when we’re acting against our values; this to encourage us toward a more meaningful journey through life. Taken together, we maintain hope and continue to seek meaning in the face of what Frankl called “tragic optimism,” creating personal enrichment against the unavoidable whetstones of pain, death, and guilt.56

We tell stories to ourselves and each other, narratives that help us navigate our feelings and problems. A narrative informed by logotherapy can encourage us through a lifetime of challenges, showing us how to find strength through recognizing our own limitations. It can lead us to thrive and discover joy, even in the worst of circumstances.

ANOTHER KIND OF THERAPY . . . BUT IT’S NOT FOR

EVERYBODY

I teach a graduate course in public speaking. I give lectures and lead discussions, but the most valuable part is the assignments. Week after week, each student selects a topic, prepares their materials in advance, then has to deliver a six-minute talk in front of a full classroom. You never know when it’ll be your turn. When I draw your name, you get one minute to gather your thoughts and set up your slides, then you have to start talking.

It’s an intimidating experience. Every semester a few students drop the course on the first night. But for those who stick around, the payoff comes fast. The day after their first presentation, I often receive satisfied messages from my students. A recent text: “I have a terrible fear of speaking in front of a room. A little of that went away after class.” Confronting a stressful situation can be the first step to being able to deal with that stress—and also toward gaining control over unwanted behavior.

We can quickly improve our behavior when we face our fears head on, especially when the thing we fear does not pose a physical threat. This is called exposure therapy. One version of exposure therapy involves a gradual approach. If you’re afraid of driving over bridges, you could start by crossing a very short bridge, then move to longer and longer ones. The other version is much faster, known as “flooding.” In this case, you begin with the most intense version of your fear and experience it completely for an extended time. You could do that by visiting, for instance, Louisiana’s Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, which at twenty-four miles is the longest bridge in the United States. If you can cross that one, you can cross them all. In both gradual exposure and flooding, the technique is to experience the fear to gain a reflexive understanding that the danger is imagined, not real, and that the bad feeling is only a feeling, not the reflection of a real threat. You do not attempt to fight it and you do not flee. If a therapist or support person is in attendance, they only observe.

Flooding is stressful and not for everyone, but the payoff is big: it tends to work fast. A few people are freed from their fear after a single session, though booster sessions are typically required or at least helpful, as subsequent efforts reinforce your new capacity. The flooding experience can ultimately reset the body’s fight-or-flight system. Once that occurs, a situation that you previously experienced as a fusion of feeling followed by thoughtless reaction is now three experiences: the emotion of exposure, the processing by the observing self, and the calculated reaction. You gain the revelatory understanding that despite your fear, nothing terrible has befallen you. (Remember, we’re talking about fears of things that are not dangerous.) You get the further benefit of having this experience while inside the belly of the beast—or rather what you thought was a beast. This profound realization, occurring in a moment of high emotion, can quickly condition your mind to simply remove panic or obsession from the menu of

options when you’re confronted with the frightening thing in the future.57

We are thus able, sometimes very quickly, to get rid of the feeling by robbing it of its motivational effect.

A variation of exposure therapy, Cue Exposure Therapy, is often used for addictive behaviors and certain compulsive behaviors, and some people may find it useful for other issues similarly related to dopamine. The idea is to break the link between a troubling cue and an unwanted response. Over time this approach can weaken or outright eliminate the association.

Consider a simple case. Let’s say you catch a glimpse of the power light on your Xbox, and that triggers a strong urge to play a video game. You know, however, that your time would be better spent on a project for work that’s due in a few hours. Allow yourself to feel the attraction of the activity. Let it truly sweep you up. At this point, you have three things to do.

1. Commit to riding out the feeling, also known as “surfing.” This means acknowledging that the feeling will pass, and accepting the unpleasantness of the here-and-now experience by reminding yourself that it is only a feeling and there is no threat. 2. You can more ably do this by carrying out the second task: using coping strategies such as relaxation practices, finding distractions, and asking yourself direct questions about the value of unhelpful or discouraging thoughts. 3. With this much achieved, act on the third task, engaging with the observing self. Exercise mindfulness. Consider what you want in the moment compared to your larger goals for your behavior. You’ll think about not just reason and fact but also your aspirations, self- image, and values. In this way you will gain control over a stressful moment by pausing to seriously consider what you want for yourself and how to get it.

In the Xbox example, you’d begin by accepting the unpleasant feeling: I want to play but I’m going to try to skip it. There’s a conflict between what I want now and what I want in the long run. This feels lousy but it’s only a feeling. The worst that can happen is I’ll feel bummed. There’s no danger here.

Then, use coping strategies to make that frustration easier to accommodate. For instance, try “box breathing”: close your eyes, breathe in through your nose to the count of four, hold your breath to the count of four, then breathe out through your mouth to four. Pause for a few seconds, then do this five more times. You might also try progressive muscle relaxation: sit comfortably, then tense and relax your muscles, one area at a time, starting with your toes and moving all the way up to your face. At the end, compare how much less tense your body feels to how it felt when you began. Also note that you likely feel less stressed about the situation.

Now that you’ve begun to defuse your feelings from your reaction, move to the third task: consider why you’re choosing not to play just now. Make a mental list of the benefits of not playing, and what you might achieve instead with the time. Visualize yourself later in the day. You chose not to play. Would you be proud? Happy? Frustrated? Pleased with yourself?

After the feeling from the trigger has passed, you can reflect on the entire experience to write down the things you did that helped you avoid engaging in the unwanted response. You are also entitled to give yourself some encouragement; your effort helped to diminish the connection between the trigger and the unwanted behavior, which will help you avoid that behavior more easily in the future.

In a 2021 study conducted in Australia, researchers worked with a group of individuals who self-identified as having a significant problem with online gambling.58 To help them resist the urge to use gambling apps on their phones, clinicians gave them tools to prepare before they were in a situation where the urge would strike. Researchers worked with participants individually to devise for each a detailed list of experiences—cues—that made them want to place a bet. In assembling the lists, participants spent time thinking about what did and didn’t tempt them, ranking the order of these cues, and considering the experience not just of betting but also of anticipating the act of betting and of waiting on the outcome. Researchers then exposed the participants to the cues and increased their exposure over time. The participants were asked to fully experience the feeling of the unwanted attraction to gamble, and to let themselves experience it until they became habituated to it. Over repeated efforts, all six participants in this

small but rigorous study showed improvement in their resistance to engaging in online gambling.

This study, and similar examples in and out of laboratory settings, suggests that we can better push back against unwanted behavior by exposing ourselves to it after preparing well for the experience. That effort begins with identifying the cues that bring on the unwanted urge, then equipping ourselves with strategies to process and reject it.

One especially promising outcome was that it doesn’t always take profound sacrifice for this approach to succeed. While all participants in this study wanted to beat their gambling problem, many felt it was unrealistic to stop carrying around a phone—and these participants were more successful in beating the gambling problem than the others. Given that we can’t simply eliminate most difficult dopaminergic experiences from life, it’s encouraging to know that we may be more successful by learning to cope—wearing down the habit—instead of cutting ourselves off from what troubles us.

CHOOSING AMONG THERAPIES: THE STANDARD IS

WHAT HELPS

I was trained as a scientist. Later I turned to writing and the teaching of writing. The combination enabled me to quantify certain types of professional writing so anyone can do it. But my scientific training gave me another conviction: I need an open mind because there are often other approaches that can work just as well as mine. That’s true for everything.

If you’re interested in therapy, you may find that some approach beyond the ones in this chapter is more appealing or more successful for you. That’s good news! What you’re looking for is relief and improvement. Finding anything that helps you (that doesn’t also hurt you in some other way) is an excellent outcome. A method is validated by its success.

No psychotherapies are direct descendants of completely objective science. Sigmund Freud created psychoanalysis out of his personal experiences and ideas, not from reams of data. Alfred Adler created his therapeutic approach the same way. Freud tied behavior to sexuality and violent instincts outside conscious thought because he thought it made

sense to do so. Adler stressed the need to overcome a sense of inferiority to find power as individuals. Neither of these grand theoretical edifices came from anything more than observation and analysis. They’re powerful tools, to be sure, but hardly the objective last word.

The frameworks proposed by Freud and Adler are not literal explanations of how the brain or even the mind functions. They do, however, yield insight when considered as a metaphor, and scientific theory is often most useful as predictive metaphor. In such cases, we are not overly concerned with the method of action. For instance, we can assume the sun revolves around the earth or the earth revolves around the sun. Only one is true, but both provide an accurate forecast of what we will see at sunrise tomorrow. The shocking, seemingly antiscientific conclusion is that if something forecasts the appropriate outcome in a given circumstance, that’s good enough.* It may incorrectly identify the method of action, or fail to identify any method at all, but when our goal is forecast, repair, or improvement, a system that gives good results is, for many situations, the only thing we need.

ACT is a strong tool for addressing dopamine-driven challenges, but what’s most important is whether it works for you. Consider an extreme example. I have a couple friends who are adherents of alternative approaches to psychology, things that in my understanding have at best a limited foundation in quantitative science. Whenever they bring up something about it, they precede it with, “You probably think this is nonsense, but . . .” I tell them that just because I don’t believe in how they say it works doesn’t mean it doesn’t work. In fact, they’ve told me many undeniable success stories. I’ll never grant that what they’re into comports with human biology as we have long understood it. It doesn’t. But there are lots of things in recognized medicine that shouldn’t work yet correlate with positive outcomes. Most we cannot explain, but over time we have come to understand a few. Consider the placebo effect, in which significant numbers of patients feel better despite being given an inert compound as if it were an effective drug. Recent studies show that a placebo administered within the familiar “ritual of treatment” is especially effective in pain management, stress-related insomnia, and nausea—conditions that are typically influenced by endorphin, dopamine, and other neurotransmitters.59 If you’re

in pain, unable to sleep, or nauseated, your need for relief is all that matters. If what you’re trying doesn’t work, try something else.

When you’re dealing with dopamine-related challenges, or any mental or emotional problem, the best therapy isn’t the one that looks good on paper, it’s the one that works for you. As you look for the right approach, start with what is most likely to succeed, given what has worked for other people in your situation. When it comes to dopamine-related problems, you will probably find the fastest relief with ACT. If that doesn’t work as well as you’d like, consider CBT. If you’re still having a problem, consider another practitioner within those disciplines, or look into other approaches.

DISPOSITION VERSUS DISCIPLINE

One last thing about therapy: be honest with yourself about why you’re seeking it.

Some problems are diseases or conditions—pathologies—that respond best to formal treatment. Other problems, while unpleasant, are common and occur in passing: modest marital stress, the day-to-day challenge of parenting, frustration with work. To make therapy the default option for nearly every plebeian difficulty is to reject the valuable work of self- discipline toward personal growth. This in turn denies us the opportunity to build the resilience we need to navigate the normal challenges of life.

Seek help when you need it, but think about your own abilities, too, and the resources of friends, family, faith, and experience. Many of us are anxious to pathologize every difficulty, to give it a name that leads directly to some well-known treatment. This makes sense for physical things like heart disease or diabetes, where you either have the condition or you do not. For situations involving difficult behavior and feelings, however, the “diagnosis” can be subjective. Figuring it out is made even more difficult by the fact that claiming certain conditions can gain us sympathy, status, or attention. So ask yourself, are you really dealing with illness that requires intervention, or are you attaching a fashionable name to the problem in order to avoid the hard work of fixing something that is in fact in your power to change? In other words, are you correctly diagnosing illness or are you finding a way to avoid what we like least to do: develop greater self-

awareness and discipline? I can’t help it, don’t you know—I was born this way is an easier answer than I need to say no more often.

* A friend of mine notes, “Science is always wrong.” What he means is that the explanations we have today will be refined tomorrow and that, over time, nearly all of our ideas about how the world works will be discarded. This is why scientific consensus is at once valuable and deadly: it can lead us to useful outcomes but when we treat it like unquestionable writ, we reject science itself, which is no more than another word for rational inquiry.

## Part III: Taming Big Issues, One at a Time

### Productivity and Getting Ahead

Chapter 10

PRODUCTIVITY AND GETTING

AHEAD

HOW AMBITION BECOMES REALITY

Ambition without productivity is just a dream; productivity makes it a reality.

When we come up with efficient and original ways of doing things, we gain an advantage. This requires us to tame and channel dopamine—and it’s worth doing. Even slightly improving a process can yield big benefits to the world, and those who figure it out usually end up with more money, prestige, power, and occasionally a place in history.

In 1855, the essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson confided this in his journal: “If a man . . . can make better chairs or knives, crucibles or church organs, than anybody else, you will find a broad hard-beaten road to his house, though it be in the woods.” A generation later, just after his death, the idea was credited back to him in the form that would live on: “If a man can . . . make a better mousetrap than his neighbors . . . the world will make a beaten path to his door.” Dopamine helps us recognize such opportunities, then motivates us to act and enables us to execute our ideas. It gives us the cunning and calculation to make something out of nothing or improve something we already have. Thus dopamine powers technological progress as well as our personal ability to “get ahead.” It is the chief driver of productivity and improvement for individuals and for the world.

TWO KINDS OF THINKING . . .

Coming up with superior ways to get things done is a compound process. The first step is divergent thinking, the gathering of potentially useful ideas —key word, “potentially.” Since the idea is to gather as many elements as we can in hopes of discovering something useful, the ideal approach is to take down the velvet rope and let almost anything in. If an element or idea isn’t entirely crazy, we need to entertain it. At least, that’s the goal. Most of the time, our brains automatically rule out a lot of things—because most of the time we need it to do so. If we paid attention to everything, we couldn’t get through the day.

The next time you’re walking down a busy sidewalk to get to a destination, pause to notice what you usually don’t. You’re not aware of the pavement. You’re not paying attention to the faces of strangers. You’re not aware of the patterns of the clouds in the sky, the sounds of traffic, or the feel of your clothing against your skin. Your brain takes note of all these things, but it doesn’t elevate them to your attention because you don’t need to know them. Your focus is on getting somewhere. Thinking about how your shoulders feel inside your jacket will distract you and slow you down, and your mind is focused not only on completing the task at hand but also on doing it efficiently.

Salience is the term we use to describe how important something is to us in a given situation. Our brains do this sorting—assigning levels of salience—without our conscious attention. When we’re walking down the sidewalk, the traffic nearby is of low salience to us. But when we’re crossing the street against the light, that roaring traffic is the most salient thing in our lives.

Divergent thinking is a dopaminergic process. Dopamine responds to novelty, especially novelty that might make our lives better. It’s always on the lookout for new resources. This is the realm of the desire circuit. Vigorous divergent thinking requires us to attach greater salience to otherwise ignored stimuli. We want to pay attention to the things we haven’t noticed lately or noticed much at all, the better to collect more potentially useful things.

We want these things for the second step. Here we’ll switch from gathering materials with little consideration for their usefulness to performing intellectual and emotional calculation. We’ll try out these pieces in alternative functions and new combinations. We’ll hold on to some elements, set aside others, and consider ways to connect them toward a goal. That sorting-and-solving is called convergent thinking, the complement to divergent thinking. We’ll explore connections to see what kind of useful outcomes are possible, then we’ll settle on the best one. Convergent thinking involves the control dopamine circuit that activates the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where we make decisions, solve problems, plan, organize, and carry out most other cognitive abilities. The PFC is logical, controlled, and systematic.

If I want to create a better cake, my divergent step will be to compose a list of ingredients that might be useful in a cake. Along with the basics like flour, eggs, and milk, I’ll write out other things that go in some cakes and not others, like peanuts, pecans, cashews, pieces of fruit, and cinnamon. I’ll also list things that aren’t normal in cake at all, such as peanut butter, shredded radish, melted ice cream, black pepper, tomato soup, beer, and mashed potatoes. If I’m especially expansive in this step, I’ll also include alternatives to the usual method of making a cake. Instead of baking it in an oven, I’ll consider using a grill or a smoker, or maybe a way that doesn’t require heating it up. Whatever I write down, the breadth of potential elements in the cake is limited only by my ability to overcome the low salience assigned to the many things that have faded into my mental wallpaper, the things I don’t notice. Then, in the back half of the process, I’ll focus my thinking, sorting through and combining some things and setting aside others. I’ll test, experiment, and redo the run-through in my mind. From that calculating experimentation I’ll come up with my new cake.

Nature uses this two-step process too. All kinds of genetic variability occur within organisms, but only those that increase an organism’s fitness for survival get passed along to future generations, a process called natural selection, the result of which is constructive propagation of the species. Random genetic variability is analogous to divergent thinking, and the transmission of advantageous biological features (via “survival of the fittest”) is the analog of convergent thinking.

Divergent and convergent thinking are powerfully complementary. As the poet Criss Jami said, “Create with the heart; build with the mind.” The power in the two types of thinking is in their combination: divergent for open-minded gathering, convergent for highly focused calculation. Consider some people living with ADHD, which is associated with an overactive desire dopamine circuit, leading to impulsivity. As desire dopamine overperforms, the control dopamine circuit underperforms, causing difficulty with focus and attention. This is why people with ADHD present interesting conflicts in their abilities. For instance, some appear to have an advantage when it comes to founding new companies but are at a disadvantage when it comes to managing them—the former activity is more a divergent-thinking act while the latter calls for more convergent thinking. Overall, people with ADHD are much better at the loose, flexible forms of cognition needed for divergent thinking, but struggle with the more structured cognition required for convergent thinking—they tend to be better at coming up with ideas than developing practical plans for carrying them out.

Unlike with many other kinds of psychological processing, it’s not important to cultivate a balance between these two parts. Still, the more accomplished you are at each of them, the better. We do our most impressive work using what writer Dorothy Parker called “a wild mind and a disciplined eye.”

. . . AND HOW TO DO THEM MORE EFFECTIVELY

To be more productive, both personally and professionally, improve your ability to find and build original solutions to challenging problems. To build your capacity for divergent thinking, which is the gathering of new ideas, try these techniques:

Brainstorming. It’s an oldie but it’s quite powerful. Pick the topic, problem, or concern at hand, then write down everything that comes to mind about it. Reject nothing. The idea is to give yourself access to ideas you might not ordinarily imagine. When I teach speechwriting, one of my topics is the original use of language. I ask students to craft unique metaphors for love. To move them into a more productive mindset, I first

ask them to describe something far removed from love. I usually choose a chalkboard. When we get to the end of the exercise of calling out their descriptions, we have the material for some surprising metaphors. Some of the usual things I hear:

A chalkboard is easy to erase. It comes in different colors. You can fill it with whatever you like. It’s a platform for sharing ideas. Everybody can see it. If you abuse it, people will hear. After a long time, it can wear out.

The metaphors are now easy to see and make for strong jumping-off points. Love is like a chalkboard; what you put there can be easy to erase, easy to forget—but not always. Sometimes the marks are so deep and strong that they’re never really gone, no matter how hard you wipe them away.

Another aspect of the exercise can be a useful addition to your brainstorming arsenal. I tell my students that we’re not going to limit ourselves to ten or twenty descriptions. We’re going to take as much time as we need to literally fill the board. After we get through their first hundred suggestions, the students’ well of ideas is exhausted. It’s in these last moments that their descriptions move far away from the obvious. Instead of telling me how the board looks or feels, they start talking about obscure things that are typically not salient, such as the smell of the chalk dust near the board, and how the grain of the board varies on close examination. It is at this point that the students come up with their most original ideas.*

That happens for several reasons. The incubation effect is the powerful unconscious mind asserting itself, often as a sudden insight near the end of the process. While you’ve been grappling with the problem in your conscious mind, your unconscious mind has been working furiously with a larger set of data and more diverse possibilities. The phenomenon is similar to waking up with a good idea after your unconscious mind processed the problem during sleep.† Also, working for so long wears out our conscious imagination, and the power of cognitive fatigue kicks in, diminishing our ability to suppress unusual associations. In this case, not being able to block

“silly” or “wrong” ideas is exactly what we need. Finally, the power of group dynamics is also in play. The combination of rapport and competition in a group can push us to reach for ideas that we might not otherwise find. It can also give us the confidence to share those odd ideas.

Brainstorming calls on dopamine in at least two ways. When we come up with a new idea, it can trigger a small dopamine release that in turn can create a feedback loop that drives the creation of more ideas. Brainstorming is also a focus on the novel and new, and finding such things triggers dopamine.

Reverse reasoning. Think about the opposite of what you’re trying to achieve. Instead of asking how to solve a problem, ask how someone might cause the problem, or even how to make it worse. Then try to “solve” that “reverse” problem. The result: You will often see aspects of the original problem that were previously obscured. For instance, if you’re trying to figure out how to make it easier for customers to return unwanted items, you might ask how you could make returns more difficult. Walk through the process from the customer’s perspective but in a new way. You’ll be on the lookout for problems a customer encounters during a return—even minor issues because, after all, you’re trying to create or amplify the trouble along the way. This can reveal new perspectives on and elements of the original problem.

One way to make returns more difficult might be to add a lengthy form to the front of the process. You might limit the hours and days when someone can return an item. You could make unreasonable requirements of the customer, such as maintaining the original packaging in perfect condition. You might add a restocking fee that makes a return more expensive than it’s worth. Of course, the idea is not to explore the value of these proposals but to see how they point us toward pain points we might not have noticed otherwise—in this case, pointless paperwork, inconvenient hours of access, unrealistic rules on packaging, and unreasonable restocking fees. Now we have a first-attempt list of potential improvements. This approach has an advantage over traditional brainstorming because it leverages our interest in stories and narratives. That can naturally take us through a series of connected ideas in a process.

To build your capacity for convergent thinking, which is the synthesis of ideas toward a solution, try these techniques:

Assemble a list of pros and cons. One of the challenges of convergent thinking is comparing the quality of solutions. For each proposal, create a simple, two-column diagram, one for advantages and one for disadvantages. It’s easy to do and can be a strong first step toward making a choice. Beyond giving you data on which to base your decision, it also guides you through quantifying benefits and drawbacks and prioritizing them. You can enhance the lists by categorizing each element as objective, meaning measurable (“It’s red”) or subjective, meaning the value may vary depending on opinion (“It’s pretty”). Comparing lists for different solutions can quickly reveal gaps in what each solution can do and make clear which have benefits you cannot do without.

Create an Eisenhower Matrix. If your need for convergent thinking is less about the qualities of a solution and more about prioritizing actions— making a process or a schedule more efficient—consider this proven organizational approach.

Create a table with four categories:

1. Urgent and important (Do now) 2. Important but not urgent (Schedule) 3. Urgent but not important (Delegate or schedule soon) 4. Neither urgent nor important (Eliminate)

The idea here is that every task has a timeliness component and a value component: either urgent or not urgent, and either important or not important. In that case there are only four combinations to describe a task, which means we can assign every task to one of the four categories. Some things are obvious: if you have a broken leg, that’s urgent and important and you should do something about it right away. If you have a report for your boss, but it’s not due until next week, that’s important but not urgent, and you should make a plan—a schedule—so you can have it done on time. In practice, this is a powerful way to establish workflow through a multistep process, work through a long to-do list, or create a schedule for each day across several weeks or months.

The problem with this approach comes when the urgent/important status of a task isn’t clear-cut. Let’s say you need to talk to your partner about scheduling travel for this weekend and it’s already Wednesday. That’s

urgent and important, but it’s not so urgent that you couldn’t do it on Thursday instead. Or maybe you are miserable in your job and want to find a new place to work or even switch careers. That is terribly important and in some sense, urgent, but the world won’t collapse if you delay a decision— which you know because you’ve already delayed doing anything about it for two months.

The key to success with the Eisenhower Matrix is in how you define the words “urgent” and “important.” A good place to begin this is a thought experiment: define “urgent” as attached to significant physical, financial, or emotional consequences if action is not taken within a few hours. This would reserve the first category, urgent and important, only for short- timeline emergencies. Unless you drive an ambulance, that could be very limiting, because now most of the things you need to do are forced into category two: they are important and because of that, urgent by a different definition, so they need to be achieved in a few days or weeks. Perhaps we can modify our definition of “urgent” to be “requiring attention in the next five days”—or whatever timeframe works best for you. The point is that by attaching the requirement for action to a date certain, we gain a way to prioritize the things we need to do and then get them done.

As for categories three and four, they are a little easier to use and their definitions quite clarifying. If a task is urgent but not important, we can delegate it if we have the option to contact someone, or we can schedule it soon, calling on our revised “within five days” version of “urgent.” That takes care of the third quadrant. As for the fourth, things that are neither urgent nor important can be eliminated. This is where a lot of your peace will come.

A few years ago, I was teaching a writing seminar when one of the students approached me afterward. She appreciated the material and wanted to gift me with some consulting on her approach to running a small business. “How long is your to-do list?” she said.

“Thirteen pages,” I said. “And how long have you had this list?” “About two years,” I said. She told me to break it up according to the Eisenhower Matrix, adding that probably about half of it would end up in category 4. She was correct and I discarded those tasks. To this day I do not remember what they were,

and I am better off for having abandoned them. After that she hooked me on the practice of scheduling my work on a calendar. Not only does it get done in a timely way, I get the dopamine-hit satisfaction of achieving goal after goal after goal, every day.

By building convergent and divergent thinking using well-defined methods, we can put originality in service to productivity—and we don’t even have to feel particularly inspired to do so.

THE ART IN NUMBERS AND THE NUMBERS IN ART

The world is filled with successful, productive people who are good at both math and art. Michelangelo was a sculptor, painter, poet, and scientist. The son of a painter, nineteenth-century engineer James Nasmyth constructed heavy machine tools but also drew amazingly detailed lunar landscapes. Steve Jobs co-created the personal computer—the first business machine that was also aesthetically pleasing, even exciting. Former US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice is not only a diplomat but also an accomplished concert pianist. Comic actor Rowan Atkinson, the creator of the Mr. Bean character, holds a degree in electrical engineering. Actor-comedian Ken Jeong is a physician. Nagarjuna (full name Akkineni Nagarjuna Rao) is a prolific Indian actor and film producer who holds a master’s degree in automobile engineering.

Some people who aren’t good with numbers wear it like a crown. “I’m an artist,” they say. “I’m not a math person at all, don’t wanna be.” Some number types proudly dismiss art. “I had to work hard to learn how to do this,” they say, “but that painting/song/performance? Anybody could knock that out.” Both are missing out. That their outputs are measured objectively or subjectively is, from a neuroscientific perspective, incidental. At the core, both call on the same dopaminergic skills: manipulating abstractions, engaging in divergent gathering and convergent reasoning, and mentally modeling what does not yet exist.

Familiarity with both art and math is becoming more important. Not only does simultaneous skill in both lead to greater opportunities, many modern pursuits now require it. Carnegie Mellon University recognized this when in 2022 they launched a new degree program for a Bachelor of

Engineering Studies and Arts. To introduce the effort, the university showcased Professor Thomas Sullivan, who is affiliated with both the School of Engineering and the School of Music. His work includes sound processing for guitars that captures the individual strings (known as “hexaphonic processing”) and the use of technology for including sound and light in art installations.84

If you’re an artistic type who thinks you can’t do numbers, give it another chance. Start with the basics of arithmetic. Pick up a book from the For Dummies series such as Everyday Math or Math for Real Life. If you already have a good grasp of arithmetic, you’ll find that introductory books on algebra, calculus, or statistics are much easier to master than you expect —being motivated to learn these things for practical reasons instead of academic ones tends to make things easier. Also consider apps such as Duolingo—recently expanded to include math training—that “gamify” learning. You’ll find that the step-by-step approach will leverage your dopaminergic reward system to sustain your interest. You’ll also sense something familiar: The circuits you’ve relied upon in one realm will now fire toward mastery in another.

If you’re a numbers- or reason-focused type mystified by the attraction of art, start with the thing you do best, logical thinking. Approach the “mystery” the way you approach any other problem, by inventorying its qualities (divergent thinking) and, from that exercise, finding ways to make sense of it intellectually (convergent thinking). Consider a painting. Don’t ask questions that just lead to navel-gazing, such as whether it’s pretty or what the artist was trying to say. Ask questions that leverage your skill for objective analysis. For instance, note how large or small the canvas is. Ask how this affects the level of detail that’s possible to put in the space given the size of the subject. How deeply did the artist exploit the possibilities of the medium? What are the elements of the image? Is there a visual center to what you see, and if so, where is it located? What colors are in use? How do they relate to colors in real life? What is the effect of light? What is the texture of the painting and how does it affect what you see?

There are lots of reasons to learn to appreciate art, but one of the best is to enrich your appreciation of everything else. Art can give you fresh ways to consider what you already know and push you toward new thinking

about the familiar. Regarding math, one of the great things about appreciating numbers and logic is that it allows you to recognize order in things that can seem chaotic. This in turn can reveal “methods to the madness” that enhance the abilities you already have. From either side, embracing the other realm will grow your productivity in everything, and draw you toward a richer, more fulfilling life.

THE MULTITASKING TRADE-OFF

We can do only one thing at a time. What we call multitasking isn’t some workaround for this limit, it’s just stopping an activity and moving to another. When you think about it that way, you understand why multitasking doesn’t help you get things done faster. In fact, it slows you down, because the more transitions you make, the more time you waste. As much as 40% of the time you spend multitasking goes not to the work you’re doing but to the act of switching between the jobs and mentally reorienting.85 All this setting and resetting of our brains introduces error, slows execution, impairs learning, and makes us more susceptible to distraction.

But that’s not the end of the story. Although multitasking won’t make our productivity faster, it can make us more original.

Cognitive fixation is a bias toward the known. It occurs when we restrict our thinking to familiar methods and ideas—when control dopamine is firmly in charge, using the linear tools of rational thought to solve a problem and confining us to consider only what is, not what might be. Artificial intelligence researcher Tony McCaffrey suggests a tragic example:86 The people on the Titanic overlooked the possibility that the iceberg could have been their lifeboat. Newspapers from the time estimated the size of the iceberg to be fifty to one hundred feet high and two hundred to four hundred feet long. Titanic was able to navigate for a while and could have pulled aside the iceberg. Many people could have climbed aboard it, McCaffrey postulates, to find flat places to stay out of the water for the four hours before help arrived. But the passengers were fixated on the fact that icebergs sink ships. Therefore they overlooked the possibilities of using the

iceberg as a temporary “boat.” They didn’t consider its size and shape, or the fact that it would not sink.*

With an understanding of cognitive fixation, let’s return to a consideration of multitasking. Switching from one task to another reduces the time we spend constructively working. But multitasking has a benefit: when we’re yanked away from familiar thinking, we seem to open ourselves to fresh approaches. In one study, researchers directed a group of participants to alternate tasks on command. Another group was allowed to switch on their own. About half of the directed group successfully solved problems that required original thinking, compared to only 12% of those who switched at their own discretion.87 Interrupting typical thinking—not just multitasking on our own but multitasking on external command— seems to push us toward unconventional problem solving. Sticking to the normal ways of thinking until we tire of them—multitasking when we’ve come to a dead end—doesn’t have nearly as powerful an effect.

If you’re working to solve a problem, try jarring yourself out of cognitive fixation. Set a timer and force yourself to switch between tasks every few minutes or, better yet, choose random intervals, or put the choice in the hands of someone else. What you lose in efficiency, you may make up in originality.

* There’s a story, likely apocryphal, that has long floated around Washington, DC, communications circles. A now-defunct website known for its catchy, clickbait headlines came up with them through calculated brainstorming. The rumor was that staff would sit in a room and write no fewer than two hundred headlines for every story. The one they published would always be one of the last ten or so they came up with—because that’s when the truly unique ideas appeared. † I’ll expand on the connection between dreams and creativity in chapter 16. * For the sake of completeness, smart aleck, I acknowledge that not everyone agrees this could have worked.

### Cultivating Creativity

Chapter 16

CULTIVATING CREATIVITY

FOR MY NEXT TRICK . . .

One of my hobbies is magic. I started performing up-close and stage magic as a teenager and never stopped. Although I often like to open my seminars and keynotes with an illusion to illustrate the topic at hand, I enjoy studying techniques and “secrets” of magic even more. There’s no other discipline like it.

When I studied math and physics, I learned a great catalog of principles and techniques, then applied those approaches over and over to various situations. But when it comes to magic, there are few principles that get used repeatedly. Nearly every trick requires a unique method; for instance, the technique behind making a coin disappear is good for only that and not much more. The same goes for making an object float in the air, mindreading, and sawing your assistant in half. The science of science calls for a consistent approach used repeatedly. The science of magic calls for a stream of one-of-a-kind ideas used for a single purpose and probably nothing else. To create a new magic trick is to engage in profoundly creative thinking, because you have to blaze your own trail, and likely think in a way that no one has before.

People who design original magic use the brain in ways that—ahem— most people aren’t creative enough to imagine. Magic demands constant invention because every trick is a new puzzle, a fresh challenge to the

ingenuity of the mind. In this way, the work of designing magic is also the dopamine system firing on all cylinders: it requires serious creativity.

HOW TO BE CREATIVE WITHOUT TRYING

Creativity is in many ways an unconscious act, but there are things we can do purposefully and consciously to increase our creativity.

You’ve heard the old saying that “life is what happens while you’re making other plans.” In the same way, creativity is what happens when you’re doing other things—and dopamine is all about bringing us into contact with other things. That’s why people who rely on their creativity for their art or their employment often carry a notebook. When an unusual thought occurs to them, they write it down. It could be a different perspective on an old idea, a combination that hadn’t occurred to them before, an unusual phrase, a provocative image, a striking turn of phrase, a word that sounds strange—and none of these arrived by looking for them. This is how creativity often works: the unconscious mind sorts through the otherwise low-salience stimuli hanging around inside us, weighing raw input and promising combinations for novelty and utility. The output might be fully formed or not. It might be something to prompt further thought later. Whatever comes out, our minds are doing divergent and convergent processing in the background, then offering up a potentially useful result as it appears.

We get far fewer original ideas from “thinking harder” than we do from letting our minds wander. Illustrator and graphic designer Christoph Niemann says, “I hate so much the idea of no control, but this approach of not planning opens a new door. It’s really hard, but it just leads to these magic moments.”125 We can invoke Dorothy Parker’s “disciplined eye” at will. It’s the wild mind that comes more often unbidden. Creative thinkers covet those moments.

Breakthroughs not just in art but also in engineering, mathematics, language, and science come when creative minds take paths that no one else has followed. Wandering from the well-worn path happens most often when we let our minds wander to other matters—ironically, when we’re not trying to be creative at all. By being aware that creativity arrives on an

uncertain schedule along unexpected roads, we can be on the lookout for useful material and capture it—in a notebook, a text, an email, or something else. Being creative is just as important as noticing when you’re being creative and not even trying.

PRACTICE!

You’ve heard the old joke: How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice, practice, practice!126 Turns out that, in one key way, creativity is a skill like playing baseball or speaking a foreign language: the more you do it, the more accomplished you get.

Creativity is built on connection. Isaac Newton connected the acceleration of an apple falling from a tree with the orbits of the planets around the sun. Charles Darwin developed the theory of evolution by connecting his observations of species variation with James Hutton’s ideas about changes occurring over geologic time scales. Making connections in the world seems, well, connected to connections within the brain. Researchers estimate the strength of these neural connections by measuring whether activation of one brain network leads to simultaneous activation of the other. Think of it like figuring out which cord on the power strip is the one connected to your computer: you jiggle it at the laptop end and see which one moves at the other end.

One way to test the strength of these neural connections is the Remote Associates Test. This protocol measures how well a person can make connections between seemingly unrelated words. Each question presents three cue words that are linked by a fourth word, which is the correct answer. Sample items include safety/cushion/point and pie/luck/belly.*

A group of neuroscientists found that people who get high scores on tests of creativity and who are successful in creative fields have strong connections among three networks within the brain.127 We’re already familiar with two of the three regions, the desire and control dopamine pathways. The third region is called the default mode network, which becomes active when we’re daydreaming. These three networks likely promote creativity this way. First, the default mode network produces daydreams. Its strong connection to the desire circuit delivers whatever

novelty dopamine is detecting, and that too may become a part of a daydream. The control pathway then evaluates the resulting ideas and selects the ones that are potentially useful. The researchers were right: strong connections make strong creativity. Repeated activation of brain circuits makes the connections stronger among them. “Cells that fire together wire together” is how psychologist Donald Hebb described it. That’s why when you practice something, it becomes easier to do, including creativity. When another group of scientists tested this idea with creative people, they saw that it was true. As professional pianists improvised jazz music, the researchers saw specific regions within the cerebral cortex lighting up. When they measured the level of connectivity among these regions, they found it was directly related to how much time a particular pianist had devoted to improvisational practice.

Creative ideas often feel like they come out of nowhere, but there really is a source. They come from regions within the brain that we can’t directly access. Still, we can make use of it. Although we can’t often summon a creative solution to a difficult problem on demand, we can make its appearance more likely. All we have to do is practice. If we strengthen the neural connections associated with creativity, there’s a good chance our efforts will pay off.

If you want to build your creative capacity, start doing some creative thing frequently: draw pictures, write stories, figure out story problems in a math book, work puzzles. Building your brain connections will build your creative ability. To return to that old joke, if you want to get ahead, you’ve got to practice, practice, practice.

REDECORATE AND REFRESH

Another way to build your creative capacity is to surround yourself with inspiration.

Customize your office, studio, or workspace. Cover your walls with things that comfort you and challenge you at the same time. I’ve done this in my office. The walls of this former one-car garage are crammed with framed pieces from floor to ceiling. In some places the frames are so close you can barely see the wall between. I have about two hundred objects

ranging from autographs and antique political buttons to full-sized movie posters. One of my most prized possessions: an original poster from the movie Midnight Cowboy complete with the X rating in the lower left-hand corner. I also have autographs from Bob Dylan, Don Knotts, Robert De Niro, and Vince Gilligan, and a photo in front of Broadway’s Belasco Theatre of me with Bryan Cranston, the actor who played Walter White on Breaking Bad, a show whose moral questions will always draw me in. Wherever my eyes fall, I get a happy memory and a little creative provocation, plus a blast of inspiration from my creative heroes. They followed their dreams. So can I. Todd Lubart, professor of psychology at the Université de Paris, said that while we all take inspiration from the world around us, “some people use better grade fuel.”128

Explore what you think doesn’t matter. Creative people aren’t picky. They take in what others pass by, even when it doesn’t appear to be relevant to their work. I advise my students, “If you want to become a better writer, learn a bit of a new language. Read an article about something new. Spend an afternoon at the museum looking at art.” Refill your stock of potential creative elements as an ongoing act of divergent thinking. Seek out what you’ve ignored. Open your mind.

Engage with art. A study done in South Korea found that when volunteers were asked to generate creative ideas for business, such as designing a computer keyboard, naming a pasta brand, or thinking of new ways of recycling, those who had viewed art prior to the exercise generated a larger number of ideas and their ideas were more original (i.e., less obvious).129 There is power in pretty things.

Get into nature. Although cities present us with creative architecture, street art, dynamic advertisements, and dissonant experiences for our senses, natural environments seem to enhance creativity even more than those things.130 Perhaps nature restores our capacity to pay attention.131

That’s important because purposeful divergent thinking is fatiguing. After a while, we run out of energy for it. Spending time in a natural environment is less demanding, yet the diversity of what’s available there is still a source of new material.

Once something captures our interest, paying attention to it no longer requires effort. This is called fascination, and it’s why children with ADHD

can spend hours focusing on a video game but become distracted after only a few minutes of homework. All kinds of natural phenomena are inherently interesting to human beings, but nature doesn’t monopolize our attention— call it a “soft” fascination because it leaves room for reflection and restoration. The “hard” fascination of something that absorbs us completely is more experiential than reflective. Nature doesn’t require our concentration. The familiar, even gentle stimulation fairly invites reflection, which is the path to new perspectives—to creativity.

Not everyone has a park nearby, and that’s okay. Try background recordings of wind, rain, or natural sounds. Even pictures of nature132 seem to help, as do plants.133

USE YOUR DREAMS

Aldous Huxley advised us to “dream in a pragmatic way,” meaning we should tailor even our biggest plans to fit the possible. But the philosophy that dopamine leads us to is less like Huxley’s and more like George Bernard Shaw’s, who said we ought to “dream things that never were”—a dopamine specialty—“and say, ‘why not.’ ”*

When you sleep, your brain operates differently than it does when you’re awake. The levels of H&N chemicals go down and dopamine goes up. This can be useful for anyone trying to be more creative. While we are not closed off from our senses during sleep, they become less important to our mental processing than dopamine, which can now make uninterrupted connections among whatever is already on your mind or hiding away in memory.

For most of us, this unimpeded dopamine experience is the closest we will come to experiencing aspects of mental illness. We know this is true because when we compare the dream stories of healthy people and the waking stories of those with severe mental illness, there is no difference. It’s not a surprise: many of the pathways of healthy creativity also activate during schizophrenic experiences. Art, especially music, is full of examples of the result of overstimulated dopamine circuits, whether brought on by mental illness, drugs, or both. While drugs are risky and mental illness is painful, some of the creative products they’ve produced are beautiful,

amazing, and moving. But you don’t have to get high or suffer mental illness to stimulate yourself toward creativity. Dreams can inspire anyone.†

Episodes of dreaming occur throughout the night, with the first episode usually beginning around ninety minutes after you first fall asleep. Dreams are often characterized by bizarre, irrational material, but dreaming isn’t the only time during sleep that our minds generate bizarre ideas. It also happens just as we’re crossing the threshold from wakefulness to sleep. This twilight of consciousness is when we sometimes get our best ideas. It’s called hypnagogia.

As we’re drifting off, our thoughts tend to become muddled. Reality twists and warps, mingling with our own imaginings. The mind travels from one idea to another more fluidly, often along irrational pathways. If you’ve been focused on a specific activity before going to bed, that may dominate the experience as you drift off. This has been called the Tetris effect because people who play the video game Tetris for extended periods often find themselves compulsively thinking about how shapes in the real world can be rotated to fit together.

If you’ve been working hard on a problem before you go to sleep, the hypnagogic state may produce divergent, solution-oriented thoughts on the matter. Usually, however, the state slips by unnoticed. The exception? When we happen to wake up in the middle of it. American inventor Thomas Edison (who acquired over a thousand patents) found this state to be so productive, he came up with a clever strategy for ensuring he would retain the ideas that were generated. He would settle himself into a comfy chair and close his eyes to go to sleep. In his hand, he would hold a heavy metal ball. Muscles relax in the hypnagogic state, so when he reached it, the ball would fall to the floor with a loud bang and wake him up. That allowed him to jot down any creative ideas that had emerged during the hypnagogic state. The surrealist painter Salvador Dalí did something similar using a heavy key. One can easily imagine the dopaminergic state of hypnagogia being of great value to a surrealist.

Scientists tested this strategy in the laboratory by giving volunteers math tests.134 All the problems could be solved through a straightforward though laborious method—but there was a sneaky, easy solution too. After working on the problems for a while, half the volunteers were instructed to

take a nap. The scientists monitored their brain activity so they could wake them during the hypnagogic state. The volunteers reported strange visions that seemed to be loosely related to the research. They described “dancing numbers and geometrical shapes, the Roman Colosseum, and a hospital room with a horse.”

Among the volunteers who took the interrupted nap, 83% found the hidden key to the math test compared to only 30% of those who stayed awake. The effect disappeared if a volunteer was allowed to enter a deeper stage of sleep. One of the researchers commented, “Our findings suggest there is a creative sweet spot during sleep onset. It is a small window which can disappear if you wake up too early or sleep too deep.”

Among the nappers who found the key, the insight didn’t happen right away. The solution tended to dawn on them after they went back and spent a considerable amount of time wrestling with the problems. It’s reminiscent of the luck of the prepared. The desire dopamine system doesn’t deliver on command, but this research suggests there are ways we can work with it to make it an ally.

When you wake from a dream, you’re conscious at the same time dopamine is the most powerful force in your brain. Your thinking is more fluid, you’re making leaps from topic to topic, and logic doesn’t matter. This can be the most creative moment of your day. The trick is catching the memory of those dreams before they fade away. To take advantage of this kind of creativity, make a plan to make use of the moments just after you wake up, a time we referred to in The Molecule of More as “this crack between two worlds.”

Focus deeply on a problem of interest just before you go to bed. The brain continues to work on problems while we’re asleep. By making a problem the last thing you think of as you drift off, you’re “assigning” the task to your unconscious mind, a powerful source of original thinking and new ideas. Have you ever had an answer just come to you out of the blue? That was a product of unconscious processing. “Sleeping on it” is a way to access this power.

Put a notebook by your bed. When you wake up, write down what’s on your mind.

Write it down right away. Don’t simply say you’ll remember it later. You won’t. In those moments that your brain isn’t fully engaged in

conscious thought, your memory isn’t either.

Don’t judge it for value. Treat it as what it is, a contribution to divergent thinking.

Don’t try to make sense of it right away. It’s probably symbolic and metaphorical. Analyze it later.

Decide to be open to the unlikely. Let dopamine do what it does best.

DON’T WAIT FOR SOMEONE TO GIVE YOU THE GO-

AHEAD

As you learn in elementary school, two plus two is four. And it’s going to be four every day, all day. You can swear it’s five and that won’t change a thing. But sadly, facts don’t matter in every situation. Comedian John Mulaney says, not entirely joking, that a lot of getting through college “is just your opinion.” In a literature class, he says, you might raise your hand and say, “‘I think Emily Dickinson’s a lesbian,’ and they’re like, ‘Partial credit!’”135

When it comes to predicting who will be creative, researchers rely a lot on “partial credit.” That’s because in a few areas of “knowledge” there aren’t that many facts to have—at least facts that are useful. Since we know more about the ingredients of creativity than its process, tests of creative potential are usually just subjective, even opinion-driven inventories of qualities. That’s a limited approach. Saying, “This person lacks certain characteristics so they’re less likely to be creative” is like saying, “This car has no gasoline engine so it’s probably not going to work.” Tesla, anyone? Thinking about creative potential as ticking the required boxes is a poor way to approach the matter.

Consider one of the most widely accepted tests of creativity, the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT). It focuses only on divergent thinking. The reasoning phase, convergent thinking, goes begging, yet the TTCT is among the most widely respected and widely used of these exams. It tests for five abilities:136

• Fluency, the creation of multiple ideas relevant to the first • Originality, the creation of original ideas that are statistically rare

• Elaboration, the development of additional related ideas • Abstractness of Titles, the creation of abstract ideas to convey the essence of a category • Resistance to Premature Closure, the processing of new ideas on a sustained basis

If you took the test, would scoring low on one or more of these discourage you from trying to be creative? After all, it’s a test created by experts. Shouldn’t they know? But wait—before you decide you’re not creative, consider this: earlier versions of the test measured only four of these abilities. You might have come out as “creative” on that version and feel great about yourself. Too bad you took the newer version. Hmm.

Perhaps you could see how you do on other tests. There are quite a lot, such as the thirty-four yes–no items of the Biographical Inventory of Creative Behaviors; the Creative Product Inventory and its categories of Generation, Reformulation, Originality, Relevancy, Hedonics,* Complexity, and Condensation; and the Creative Product Semantic Scale with its three axes of Novelty, Resolution, plus the grab-bag twofer of Elaboration and Synthesis. Oh—and be sure to bring an extra pencil, because educators and psychologists typically assess creativity with an intelligence test, too, such as the Stanford–Binet.

Make no mistake, these tests are valid investigative tools. They measure what they say they measure and do so accurately. They have their uses. The problem is attaching the word creativity. That skill is simply too big, too multidimensional, and too beyond our imagination to be dissected “by the numbers” at this point in time. The brain in many ways remains a mystery, and creativity is an especially challenging process to quantify.

The beautiful thing about creativity is that it is infinitely pliable in appearance and definition. That’s good news for those who appreciate creativity, but for anyone who wants to measure it, it’s a stopper.

Here’s the point: Start being creative right now. Don’t wait for some test (or, God forbid, some “expert”) to predict whether you’ll succeed. The ability to be creative is in every one of us. It requires only exercise and cultivation.

As a university professor, I meet lots of people who are certain that once they are equipped with a formal imprimatur, they will be able to start in on

what they really want to do. That’s true for electrical engineering but not for aspiring painters, musicians, writers, comedians, philosophers, landscape artists, and so forth. It makes me sad to meet people who need external validation before they will pursue the creative life they want. For every great singer coming out of years of classical training, there are dozens more who got good at it by doing it for fun on their own. For every novelist who spent a couple semesters at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, there are hundreds who decided they’d like to write a novel instead of just read one, opened a Word document, and started filling the pages. Training is fine but it’s not necessary. Creativity itself is already inside you.

If you want to be creative, you already believe that it’s going to be fun. That’s reason enough to get started. If you find the work isn’t for you, it’s a safe bet that a certificate won’t change how you feel. Personally, I play guitar because I like it, not because I’m good at it. Creativity is a delight no matter how good you are at the start. Aptitude doesn’t matter, only desire.

BUILDING A CREATIVE STATE OF MIND

You know the quote: Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.137 It’s the same for creative power. Creativity is the product of dopamine circuits in the brain, largely hidden and mostly inscrutable. Inspiration arrives unbidden and without warning, as if the universe has blessed you with the answer. Even when we know what’s really going on in terms of neuroscience, the feeling remains of having experienced a miracle. The good news is that we understand enough about creativity that we can make miracles more likely.

It begins with the cultivation of a state of mind favorable to the process. We must use our conscious mind to make our unconscious mind aware of what we’d like to figure into the answer we seek: our likes and dislikes, limits, sensibilities, skills, long-term goals, short-term desires, and what we’re willing to accept in the end. From that, the creative process proceeds as dopamine-driven speculation about the future using all those building blocks of the here and now. In short, our ability to creatively imagine the future depends on our ability to interact with the present. We assemble what might be out of what is and derive order out of disorder. This is how

humankind acquires what we did not have before: new, highly valuable, often life-changing insights, methods, and technologies.

You will be more creative if you emphasize the gathering phase as a separate act from the analysis phase, and if you improve and expand your catalog of other abilities. The methods and encouragements in this chapter are all things you can easily make a part of your life. Also, unlike some of the techniques for addressing other kinds of dopamine-related challenges, the things that build creativity are almost all easy and fun. The most effective thing you can do to be more creative? Practice new ways of thinking in everything you do:

Give it all you have. Louis Pasteur, who discovered the principles of vaccination, famously said, “Chance always favors the prepared mind.” Original ideas don’t appear out of nowhere. They come from a vigorous approach to life and a mind filled with facts and understanding. It’s been called “the luck of the diligent.”138 So when you need to learn something new, don’t learn it halfway. Learn it completely. And when you work at something, don’t give it half an effort. Give it all you have.

Seek out whatever is different, unusual, or out of place. Our sense of salience directs us away from anything that seems less than useful, but we can override this habit with the conscious mind. One aspect of embracing the here and now is giving purposeful consideration to the things around you, especially those things that you’ve typically ignored. Start looking for them. Break the tendency to overlook ideas that fall outside the expected domain. One reason that fortune favors the bold is it takes a bold personality, or at least a highly confident one, to entertain ideas from any source.

Look for novel uses for ordinary objects. This can strengthen the connections between diverse regions within the brain and make you more creative overall.

Occasionally work on several things at once. As we’ve seen, switching between several tasks rapidly shakes you free from cognitive fixation. Scheduled task-changing is more effective than changing on your own. The otherwise inefficient approach of multitasking can shake you out of your usual ways of thinking and open you to new habits and, hopefully, fresh, creative answers.

Switch sides. Artists gain creativity by growing their capacity with quantitative reasoning, and logic-minded people gain creativity when they apply reason to what seems subjective. There is often exquisite order within chaos, and intricate beauty within order.

Plan times to let your mind wander. When your mind is unfocused, it’s kind of like sleeping while you’re awake. In moments like that, dopamine has more power and the overwhelming here and now fades. This is when creative ideas are more likely to appear. Do something aimless, or tuck into some mindless work like clearing your inbox or sorting a drawer. The more you do this, the more your creative side can root around in the latest delivery you’ve provided from the here and now.

Creativity arises out of a rich interior life. The only one who can build your mind this way is you.

* The correct answers are “pin” and “pot.” * Shaw didn’t say this off the top of his head. It’s a line of dialogue from his 1921 stage play Back to Methuselah, a three-hundred-page journey from Biblical Creation to the year AD 31,920. The line is spoken by Satan to Eve in the Garden of Eden, and it comes on the first night of a play that takes three nights to perform. With all that in mind, perhaps we should take it as a warning, not encouragement. † Some kinds of mental illness are at times associated with great creativity, but they are not conditions to leave untreated, nor is this something to aspire to. The profound suffering that can come with mental illness makes creativity more difficult to exercise, not easier. Treatment is available. If you need help, get it. You will feel better, and you deserve to. Your art will be waiting for you on the other side and it will be better under your command. * Let me save you the trouble of looking it up: hedonics is the ethical consideration of the relationship between duty and pleasure. It’s also the branch of psychology dealing with the study of pleasant or unpleasant sensations.
