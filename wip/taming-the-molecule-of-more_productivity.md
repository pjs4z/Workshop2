# Taming Molecule of More

## Introduction: Let’s Find Some Answers, then Let’s Look for . . . More

The most important chemical in the human brain is dopamine.

That’s not to say that other neurotransmitters are trivial. In fact, they are vital. Serotonin is often central to depression and its treatment. Endorphin affects mood and helps mitigate pain. Oxytocin is essential to sex, attachment, and maternal behavior. Anxiety, eating disorders, dealing with trauma—to address them, we would need a sophisticated understanding of many brain chemicals at the same time.

But when it comes to the moment-to-moment experience of modern life, dopamine is where we begin. It is the key to understanding the urges we feel and why we respond the way we do. In most matters, if you want to improve your outlook and behavior, stroll past the other neurotransmitters and start here. It isn’t even close. Navigating a romantic relationship? Dopamine. Separating lust from caring? Dopamine. Seeing through the attraction of risky behavior? Dopamine. Taming the lure of online porn, infidelity, social media, doomscrolling, getting high, giving up, putting work over family, or pushing your most important responsibilities a little further down the list of things to do? Dopamine, dopamine, dopamine.

When it comes to navigating any choice in life, dopamine pushes us toward acquisition and discovery. That’s what it evolved to do because those are useful things—they keep us alive. But the nature of the world means that along that same path, we’ll also find damaging, even dangerous

options—troubling temptations and bad ideas with visceral appeal. At those points, dopamine can and will lead us astray. Here’s why: It’s telling us at every turn, How about you trade what you already have for the possibility of something even better?

It’s just ahead, says dopamine. Trust me.

Until the past few hundred years, the primary challenge humans faced was staying alive. Anything new and unknown could be dangerous—or useful, even lifesaving. With threats and opportunities around every corner, the dopamine system evolved to give us an instant, profound, and insistent urge to investigate anything unfamiliar and unexpected. In addition, dopamine evolved to match that urge with an on-the-fly capacity for planning, reasoning, and creative thinking when we need it most. Thus, not only are we fascinated by the unknown, we also leap to explore it. Dopamine’s one- two punch has led us forward as a species: it drives us to acquire an ever- growing understanding of the world around us, then to apply what we’ve learned to gain dominion over it all.

Fast-forward to the twenty-first century, where we stand astride the world as gods. Cell phones, televisions, microwave ovens, air travel, even indoor plumbing—we have mastered our home. The science fiction of even recent decades has failed to predict as spectacular a way of life as what we have achieved. A monarch in Shakespeare’s time would tremble at a tour of our tiniest grocery store. (If he or she got that far. The sovereign would’ve had a heart attack at the sight of the car we’d take to get there, never mind the sorcery of electric lights and paved roads.) Yet we never experience a day without at least one moment when we decide that this or that miracle is getting just a tad stale—spouse, job, car, apartment, TV, sneaker, waistline, bank account. Enter dopamine.

Surely I can do better, we think. I want . . . more. Thus the irony: Dopamine has enabled us to build a world that answers most of our needs, even our whims, and has rendered that world nearly devoid of immediate threat to the point that today we rarely need dopamine’s hair-trigger response and hardcore intensity. And since

evolution is slow, this leaves us with a new problem: much of what dopamine does is now not only unnecessary but also problematic. Once they had served their purpose, dopamine’s more forceful powers didn’t make a timely evolutionary exit. They stuck around. In the modern world, that means dopamine is frequently a villain.

Dopamine does most of its vital functioning outside of our awareness and stirs up trouble wherever our conscious mind is focused. We now catch dopamine asserting itself in situations where it has nothing constructive to contribute. It revs our anticipation, drives us to distraction over unlikely threats, and tempts us with dubious opportunities that borrow our peace and break our hearts. How odd that the biological system that equipped us to build this world full of miracles would now so frequently reduce us to twitchy, dissatisfied subjects of the domain it helped us create.

Seven hundred years ago, Chaucer wrote that familiarity breeds contempt, but he identified only half the problem. Familiarity also breeds boredom, and boredom is shorthand for the experience of lacking a challenge. That matters because humans are in constant need of at least a little pushback, and that’s why the biological imperative driven by dopamine will assert itself no matter how amazing, desirable, and safe our environment happens to be. This part of the brain has wired us for restlessness. As soon as our little corner of the world runs out of surprises to keep us amused, we get antsy. That’s when the molecule of more sends us spinning off in search of something new, a restless casting about for amusement often masquerading as genuine need.

This problem isn’t new. It’s built into the human condition. Adam and Eve had the entire Garden of Eden to enjoy and even they got restless. Once you cross the finish line and claim the prize you sought, it’s only a matter of time before you get bored with it.

Not that we’re helpless against this. Dopamine drives us toward more, but it’s up to us to decide whether to embrace that motivation, modulate it, or turn it down.

That’s hard. We need to tame dopamine when it pushes us toward the more we don’t need, and let it do its thing when it promises a more worth having. This skill does not come naturally. Building our capacity for it is the subject of this book.

We’ll need something else too. We’ll need something to make us remember at every turn that this problem is more than biology and chemistry.

Against the push of dopamine-driven demands, we will need to find an outlook to give us a meaningful way to navigate life. That’s a tough one, and it has troubled humans since we first appeared on the earth. We have to figure out how to live a life that gives us not only peace for today but also optimism for tomorrow, and we’ll have to do it in a world that seems inclined against both. It’s a tall order made more demanding by the fact that the solution will not come falling from the sky. We have to find it.

In the film Crimes and Misdemeanors, here’s how a character played by psychoanalyst Martin Bergmann memorably described the problem:

We define ourselves by the choices we have made. We are in fact the sum total of our choices. Events unfold so unpredictably, so unfairly, human happiness does not seem to have been included in the design of creation. It is only we, with our capacity to love, that give meaning to the indifferent universe. And yet most human beings seem to have the ability to keep trying, and even to find joy from simple things like their family, their work, and from the hope that future generations might understand more.1

Human happiness does not seem to have been included in the design of creation.

Despite the swarming anticipation that dopamine stirs, no permanent satisfaction is automatically coming soon, no sense of completeness is for- sure bound up in events just ahead, and no fulfillment is guaranteed to be extracted from chasing the river of maybe/maybe-not promises that modern life squeezes out of dopamine.

It is only we, with our capacity to love, who give meaning to the indifferent universe.

And there it is. Not only is the day-to-day challenge of dopamine ours to address but so is the deeper need for meaning.

By dint of human nature, we are bound to try to calm the bitchy back- and-forth inside us that lurches between anticipation and disappointment. This struggle appears to be an unavoidable byproduct of the design of the brain—the wonderful, miserable motor that drives our pursuit of progress. To feel better in the face of the day-to-day challenge of dopamine, we need coping mechanisms that reflect the facts of neuroscience. But to find meaning, we must craft a narrative to attach us to purpose across a lifetime.

I submit that the daily struggles and the need for meaning are bound up together. The solution is for us to do what evolution has not: find the deus ex machina or put one there ourselves—and not just any deus will do. We must find a meaning—or, more precisely, a pursuit of meaning—that helps us really cope simultaneously with the daily, even hourly, struggles that come to us from dopamine.

Let’s begin here. The secret of life, as James Taylor sang, is enjoying the passage of time. Or as a wise young man once put it, “Life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.”2

We must decide to quit chasing the promise of tomorrow as if the pleasure we can take from today is a lesser concern. We must choose to take joy not just from pursuing what might be but also from appreciating what is. In this book, we’ll collect ways to tame the bit of biology that links serial progress with nagging dissatisfaction, but we won’t stop there. Our struggles and our triumphs ought to add up to something greater. A life that feels well lived requires us to balance the burden of wanting versus having.

It’s ironic. We are overwhelmed by the urge to pursue every potential acquisition that appears before us. But to find relief from that, you and I are obligated to search for something . . . more.

This book begins, in part I, with an explanation of what dopamine does and how it works. A tour of this neurotransmitter and its brain systems will give you an understanding of the science behind much of the day-to-day human experience. Later in the book, when we discuss ways to help you

deal with your dopamine-related challenges, this information will help you identify and more effectively apply the approaches we’ll explore.

Part II describes things you can use to drive more or less dopamine activity overall. You’ll find approaches to raise or lower the overall impact of dopamine on mood, urges, and behavior. There are compounds, treatments, and activities available right now that can make a difference in your day. We’ll also explore other prospects now being investigated.

Part III provides support, one issue at a time, for specific dopamine-related problems. Here we explore step-by-step techniques to more effectively manage particular challenges driven by the molecule of more. These approaches will help you gain greater control over the feelings and choices that trouble you the most.

“Finale” describes the most critical element in dealing with dopamine. Having addressed particular dopamine-related problems and their solutions, we now have another opportunity: to find a way to deal with the foundational feelings that make those problems occur so frequently and so intensely in our lives. For this we will fuse the discipline of neuroscience with something just as significant from the realm of ideas. I’ll propose a modern twist on an ancient way of navigating daily life so we might make for ourselves a more satisfying, more complete life.

What you find here is going to surprise you—in a good way. You can feel better. It starts with your decision to make the effort—and it’s worth it. Read on.

WHAT CAN I DO RIGHT NOW?

The point of the first book, The Molecule of More, was to show you the surprising and profound influence of dopamine in life and culture. The point of this book is to equip you with skills to help you change that influence for the better in your daily life. The recommendations you’ll find come from research into published, peer-reviewed medical and psychological studies. In some cases I spoke extensively with psychiatrist Dan Lieberman, my co-author on our original book, whose career-long specialty has been providing people with practical ways to help them feel better.

At this point, you may not be able to clearly identify which of your issues are related to dopamine, but would like to start making progress anyway, right away. Here are five simple things you can start doing now to improve the best effects of dopamine and reduce those that may be causing you trouble. Doing these things will raise your confidence and lower your anxiety—and give you a head start on taming the molecule of more.

Get regular physical activity. One well-proven way to increase constructive dopamine activity is to get some exercise. Beyond potentially boosting dopamine, regular physical activity also reinforces the exercise habit (via the dopamine reward system, which we will discuss in part I). The improvements that come with consistent exercise are likely to give you an improved mood, superior self-control, and a stronger sense of your own worth.

Prioritize sleep. Simply getting enough sleep, and getting it regularly, has far-reaching effects on the dopamine system. Sleep deprivation appears to decrease the positive effects of dopamine by reducing the availability of the receptors that allow it to function—think of having lots of cars in a city and not enough roads to drive them on.3 Good sleep habits help fix that. In addition, the dopamine system is tied to our circadian rhythms, the twenty-four-hour cycles of the body and brain. Disrupting one system can disrupt the other. Thus, good sleep provides bank-shot support for dopamine function, which in turn influences circadian rhythms related to vision, the sense of smell, certain types of motor function and reward systems, and general equilibrium among bodily systems.4

Put on some tunes. When you listen to music that you enjoy—and enjoyment appears to be key to the effect—several dopamine-oriented reward pathways in the brain are activated (including, for reasons not yet clear, pathways associated with survival). In addition, complex music with frequent variations in style, elements, and volume tends to create more neural activity than simpler music.5 Thus we have an easy way to stimulate the good feelings associated with dopamine: put on some tunes that really speak to you, songs that you love.*

Practice being still. Particular kinds of self-focus can stimulate dopamine. Consider yoga nidra, which is kind of meditation, but kind of not. Yoga nidra is best understood as the state between being awake and being asleep, a form of deep concentration and awareness that you can bring on yourself. It isn’t necessary to engage with the spiritual and philosophical aspects of yoga to make use of the practice, either. You can do it for its effects alone. But you’ll probably need help. An internet search will lead you most often to lists of vague instructions like “visualize your goal” and “find a safe place in your mind”—not much help, that. Instead, try “guided meditation”: find someone, either in person or on YouTube, who has done yoga nidra successfully and is experienced in talking others through achieving the state.

At least two studies indicate that yoga nidra (and yoga generally) increases our dopamine activity. Such a boost is usually associated with more engagement with the world around us, but the increase associated with yoga nidra seems to cause less engagement and activity, and that’s a good thing. This decline gives us some relief from the demands of executive function, the part of the mind that helps us plan, focus, remember, and multitask.6 Other benefits that yoga nidra provides include increases in serotonin, which helps govern mood, and in brain- derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which plays a role in several areas including long-term memory.

Eat right. Good nutrition keeps the body in balance and helps every system to function properly. That includes the dopamine system. A healthy diet will support your body’s ability to produce dopamine; a less- than-healthy diet will undermine that ability. It’s as simple as that.

Don’t fall for dubious promises about “dopamine-enhancing” foods. Boosting your dopamine by eating or drinking some “miracle” food is about as likely as winning a Michelin star by tossing a little saffron into your boiled chicken. Unless you’re severely malnourished, your dopamine problem is not due to a lack of foods containing the chemical components of dopamine. Lean meats, dairy products, and leafy vegetables can be good for you but they won’t cause your body to produce extra dopamine any more than having flour, butter, and sugar in the pantry automatically leads to cookies in the cookie jar. The closest

we have to dopamine-related foods are fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, which stabilize blood glucose levels. High glucose levels can unnecessarily stimulate the brain’s reward systems, but consistent levels can help us avoid difficult bursts of urges, and for now, when it comes to dopamine and eating, that’s about it.

* Why do we like music in the first place? Part of it may come from surprise. Early in life, we learn how musical scales sound, and we recognize tension and release when the musician moves between chords. Music we like plays on these expectations. Since dopamine gives us a good feeling when we are surprised in a positive way, perhaps part of the attraction is that music often meets our ingrained expectations and then exceeds them through a surprising and enjoyable change of chord, key, or melody.

### Productivity and Getting Ahead

Chapter 10

PRODUCTIVITY AND GETTING

AHEAD

HOW AMBITION BECOMES REALITY

Ambition without productivity is just a dream; productivity makes it a reality.

When we come up with efficient and original ways of doing things, we gain an advantage. This requires us to tame and channel dopamine—and it’s worth doing. Even slightly improving a process can yield big benefits to the world, and those who figure it out usually end up with more money, prestige, power, and occasionally a place in history.

In 1855, the essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson confided this in his journal: “If a man . . . can make better chairs or knives, crucibles or church organs, than anybody else, you will find a broad hard-beaten road to his house, though it be in the woods.” A generation later, just after his death, the idea was credited back to him in the form that would live on: “If a man can . . . make a better mousetrap than his neighbors . . . the world will make a beaten path to his door.” Dopamine helps us recognize such opportunities, then motivates us to act and enables us to execute our ideas. It gives us the cunning and calculation to make something out of nothing or improve something we already have. Thus dopamine powers technological progress as well as our personal ability to “get ahead.” It is the chief driver of productivity and improvement for individuals and for the world.

TWO KINDS OF THINKING . . .

Coming up with superior ways to get things done is a compound process. The first step is divergent thinking, the gathering of potentially useful ideas —key word, “potentially.” Since the idea is to gather as many elements as we can in hopes of discovering something useful, the ideal approach is to take down the velvet rope and let almost anything in. If an element or idea isn’t entirely crazy, we need to entertain it. At least, that’s the goal. Most of the time, our brains automatically rule out a lot of things—because most of the time we need it to do so. If we paid attention to everything, we couldn’t get through the day.

The next time you’re walking down a busy sidewalk to get to a destination, pause to notice what you usually don’t. You’re not aware of the pavement. You’re not paying attention to the faces of strangers. You’re not aware of the patterns of the clouds in the sky, the sounds of traffic, or the feel of your clothing against your skin. Your brain takes note of all these things, but it doesn’t elevate them to your attention because you don’t need to know them. Your focus is on getting somewhere. Thinking about how your shoulders feel inside your jacket will distract you and slow you down, and your mind is focused not only on completing the task at hand but also on doing it efficiently.

Salience is the term we use to describe how important something is to us in a given situation. Our brains do this sorting—assigning levels of salience—without our conscious attention. When we’re walking down the sidewalk, the traffic nearby is of low salience to us. But when we’re crossing the street against the light, that roaring traffic is the most salient thing in our lives.

Divergent thinking is a dopaminergic process. Dopamine responds to novelty, especially novelty that might make our lives better. It’s always on the lookout for new resources. This is the realm of the desire circuit. Vigorous divergent thinking requires us to attach greater salience to otherwise ignored stimuli. We want to pay attention to the things we haven’t noticed lately or noticed much at all, the better to collect more potentially useful things.

We want these things for the second step. Here we’ll switch from gathering materials with little consideration for their usefulness to performing intellectual and emotional calculation. We’ll try out these pieces in alternative functions and new combinations. We’ll hold on to some elements, set aside others, and consider ways to connect them toward a goal. That sorting-and-solving is called convergent thinking, the complement to divergent thinking. We’ll explore connections to see what kind of useful outcomes are possible, then we’ll settle on the best one. Convergent thinking involves the control dopamine circuit that activates the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where we make decisions, solve problems, plan, organize, and carry out most other cognitive abilities. The PFC is logical, controlled, and systematic.

If I want to create a better cake, my divergent step will be to compose a list of ingredients that might be useful in a cake. Along with the basics like flour, eggs, and milk, I’ll write out other things that go in some cakes and not others, like peanuts, pecans, cashews, pieces of fruit, and cinnamon. I’ll also list things that aren’t normal in cake at all, such as peanut butter, shredded radish, melted ice cream, black pepper, tomato soup, beer, and mashed potatoes. If I’m especially expansive in this step, I’ll also include alternatives to the usual method of making a cake. Instead of baking it in an oven, I’ll consider using a grill or a smoker, or maybe a way that doesn’t require heating it up. Whatever I write down, the breadth of potential elements in the cake is limited only by my ability to overcome the low salience assigned to the many things that have faded into my mental wallpaper, the things I don’t notice. Then, in the back half of the process, I’ll focus my thinking, sorting through and combining some things and setting aside others. I’ll test, experiment, and redo the run-through in my mind. From that calculating experimentation I’ll come up with my new cake.

Nature uses this two-step process too. All kinds of genetic variability occur within organisms, but only those that increase an organism’s fitness for survival get passed along to future generations, a process called natural selection, the result of which is constructive propagation of the species. Random genetic variability is analogous to divergent thinking, and the transmission of advantageous biological features (via “survival of the fittest”) is the analog of convergent thinking.

Divergent and convergent thinking are powerfully complementary. As the poet Criss Jami said, “Create with the heart; build with the mind.” The power in the two types of thinking is in their combination: divergent for open-minded gathering, convergent for highly focused calculation. Consider some people living with ADHD, which is associated with an overactive desire dopamine circuit, leading to impulsivity. As desire dopamine overperforms, the control dopamine circuit underperforms, causing difficulty with focus and attention. This is why people with ADHD present interesting conflicts in their abilities. For instance, some appear to have an advantage when it comes to founding new companies but are at a disadvantage when it comes to managing them—the former activity is more a divergent-thinking act while the latter calls for more convergent thinking. Overall, people with ADHD are much better at the loose, flexible forms of cognition needed for divergent thinking, but struggle with the more structured cognition required for convergent thinking—they tend to be better at coming up with ideas than developing practical plans for carrying them out.

Unlike with many other kinds of psychological processing, it’s not important to cultivate a balance between these two parts. Still, the more accomplished you are at each of them, the better. We do our most impressive work using what writer Dorothy Parker called “a wild mind and a disciplined eye.”

. . . AND HOW TO DO THEM MORE EFFECTIVELY

To be more productive, both personally and professionally, improve your ability to find and build original solutions to challenging problems. To build your capacity for divergent thinking, which is the gathering of new ideas, try these techniques:

Brainstorming. It’s an oldie but it’s quite powerful. Pick the topic, problem, or concern at hand, then write down everything that comes to mind about it. Reject nothing. The idea is to give yourself access to ideas you might not ordinarily imagine. When I teach speechwriting, one of my topics is the original use of language. I ask students to craft unique metaphors for love. To move them into a more productive mindset, I first

ask them to describe something far removed from love. I usually choose a chalkboard. When we get to the end of the exercise of calling out their descriptions, we have the material for some surprising metaphors. Some of the usual things I hear:

A chalkboard is easy to erase. It comes in different colors. You can fill it with whatever you like. It’s a platform for sharing ideas. Everybody can see it. If you abuse it, people will hear. After a long time, it can wear out.

The metaphors are now easy to see and make for strong jumping-off points. Love is like a chalkboard; what you put there can be easy to erase, easy to forget—but not always. Sometimes the marks are so deep and strong that they’re never really gone, no matter how hard you wipe them away.

Another aspect of the exercise can be a useful addition to your brainstorming arsenal. I tell my students that we’re not going to limit ourselves to ten or twenty descriptions. We’re going to take as much time as we need to literally fill the board. After we get through their first hundred suggestions, the students’ well of ideas is exhausted. It’s in these last moments that their descriptions move far away from the obvious. Instead of telling me how the board looks or feels, they start talking about obscure things that are typically not salient, such as the smell of the chalk dust near the board, and how the grain of the board varies on close examination. It is at this point that the students come up with their most original ideas.*

That happens for several reasons. The incubation effect is the powerful unconscious mind asserting itself, often as a sudden insight near the end of the process. While you’ve been grappling with the problem in your conscious mind, your unconscious mind has been working furiously with a larger set of data and more diverse possibilities. The phenomenon is similar to waking up with a good idea after your unconscious mind processed the problem during sleep.† Also, working for so long wears out our conscious imagination, and the power of cognitive fatigue kicks in, diminishing our ability to suppress unusual associations. In this case, not being able to block

“silly” or “wrong” ideas is exactly what we need. Finally, the power of group dynamics is also in play. The combination of rapport and competition in a group can push us to reach for ideas that we might not otherwise find. It can also give us the confidence to share those odd ideas.

Brainstorming calls on dopamine in at least two ways. When we come up with a new idea, it can trigger a small dopamine release that in turn can create a feedback loop that drives the creation of more ideas. Brainstorming is also a focus on the novel and new, and finding such things triggers dopamine.

Reverse reasoning. Think about the opposite of what you’re trying to achieve. Instead of asking how to solve a problem, ask how someone might cause the problem, or even how to make it worse. Then try to “solve” that “reverse” problem. The result: You will often see aspects of the original problem that were previously obscured. For instance, if you’re trying to figure out how to make it easier for customers to return unwanted items, you might ask how you could make returns more difficult. Walk through the process from the customer’s perspective but in a new way. You’ll be on the lookout for problems a customer encounters during a return—even minor issues because, after all, you’re trying to create or amplify the trouble along the way. This can reveal new perspectives on and elements of the original problem.

One way to make returns more difficult might be to add a lengthy form to the front of the process. You might limit the hours and days when someone can return an item. You could make unreasonable requirements of the customer, such as maintaining the original packaging in perfect condition. You might add a restocking fee that makes a return more expensive than it’s worth. Of course, the idea is not to explore the value of these proposals but to see how they point us toward pain points we might not have noticed otherwise—in this case, pointless paperwork, inconvenient hours of access, unrealistic rules on packaging, and unreasonable restocking fees. Now we have a first-attempt list of potential improvements. This approach has an advantage over traditional brainstorming because it leverages our interest in stories and narratives. That can naturally take us through a series of connected ideas in a process.

To build your capacity for convergent thinking, which is the synthesis of ideas toward a solution, try these techniques:

Assemble a list of pros and cons. One of the challenges of convergent thinking is comparing the quality of solutions. For each proposal, create a simple, two-column diagram, one for advantages and one for disadvantages. It’s easy to do and can be a strong first step toward making a choice. Beyond giving you data on which to base your decision, it also guides you through quantifying benefits and drawbacks and prioritizing them. You can enhance the lists by categorizing each element as objective, meaning measurable (“It’s red”) or subjective, meaning the value may vary depending on opinion (“It’s pretty”). Comparing lists for different solutions can quickly reveal gaps in what each solution can do and make clear which have benefits you cannot do without.

Create an Eisenhower Matrix. If your need for convergent thinking is less about the qualities of a solution and more about prioritizing actions— making a process or a schedule more efficient—consider this proven organizational approach.

Create a table with four categories:

1. Urgent and important (Do now) 2. Important but not urgent (Schedule) 3. Urgent but not important (Delegate or schedule soon) 4. Neither urgent nor important (Eliminate)

The idea here is that every task has a timeliness component and a value component: either urgent or not urgent, and either important or not important. In that case there are only four combinations to describe a task, which means we can assign every task to one of the four categories. Some things are obvious: if you have a broken leg, that’s urgent and important and you should do something about it right away. If you have a report for your boss, but it’s not due until next week, that’s important but not urgent, and you should make a plan—a schedule—so you can have it done on time. In practice, this is a powerful way to establish workflow through a multistep process, work through a long to-do list, or create a schedule for each day across several weeks or months.

The problem with this approach comes when the urgent/important status of a task isn’t clear-cut. Let’s say you need to talk to your partner about scheduling travel for this weekend and it’s already Wednesday. That’s

urgent and important, but it’s not so urgent that you couldn’t do it on Thursday instead. Or maybe you are miserable in your job and want to find a new place to work or even switch careers. That is terribly important and in some sense, urgent, but the world won’t collapse if you delay a decision— which you know because you’ve already delayed doing anything about it for two months.

The key to success with the Eisenhower Matrix is in how you define the words “urgent” and “important.” A good place to begin this is a thought experiment: define “urgent” as attached to significant physical, financial, or emotional consequences if action is not taken within a few hours. This would reserve the first category, urgent and important, only for short- timeline emergencies. Unless you drive an ambulance, that could be very limiting, because now most of the things you need to do are forced into category two: they are important and because of that, urgent by a different definition, so they need to be achieved in a few days or weeks. Perhaps we can modify our definition of “urgent” to be “requiring attention in the next five days”—or whatever timeframe works best for you. The point is that by attaching the requirement for action to a date certain, we gain a way to prioritize the things we need to do and then get them done.

As for categories three and four, they are a little easier to use and their definitions quite clarifying. If a task is urgent but not important, we can delegate it if we have the option to contact someone, or we can schedule it soon, calling on our revised “within five days” version of “urgent.” That takes care of the third quadrant. As for the fourth, things that are neither urgent nor important can be eliminated. This is where a lot of your peace will come.

A few years ago, I was teaching a writing seminar when one of the students approached me afterward. She appreciated the material and wanted to gift me with some consulting on her approach to running a small business. “How long is your to-do list?” she said.

“Thirteen pages,” I said. “And how long have you had this list?” “About two years,” I said. She told me to break it up according to the Eisenhower Matrix, adding that probably about half of it would end up in category 4. She was correct and I discarded those tasks. To this day I do not remember what they were,

and I am better off for having abandoned them. After that she hooked me on the practice of scheduling my work on a calendar. Not only does it get done in a timely way, I get the dopamine-hit satisfaction of achieving goal after goal after goal, every day.

By building convergent and divergent thinking using well-defined methods, we can put originality in service to productivity—and we don’t even have to feel particularly inspired to do so.

THE ART IN NUMBERS AND THE NUMBERS IN ART

The world is filled with successful, productive people who are good at both math and art. Michelangelo was a sculptor, painter, poet, and scientist. The son of a painter, nineteenth-century engineer James Nasmyth constructed heavy machine tools but also drew amazingly detailed lunar landscapes. Steve Jobs co-created the personal computer—the first business machine that was also aesthetically pleasing, even exciting. Former US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice is not only a diplomat but also an accomplished concert pianist. Comic actor Rowan Atkinson, the creator of the Mr. Bean character, holds a degree in electrical engineering. Actor-comedian Ken Jeong is a physician. Nagarjuna (full name Akkineni Nagarjuna Rao) is a prolific Indian actor and film producer who holds a master’s degree in automobile engineering.

Some people who aren’t good with numbers wear it like a crown. “I’m an artist,” they say. “I’m not a math person at all, don’t wanna be.” Some number types proudly dismiss art. “I had to work hard to learn how to do this,” they say, “but that painting/song/performance? Anybody could knock that out.” Both are missing out. That their outputs are measured objectively or subjectively is, from a neuroscientific perspective, incidental. At the core, both call on the same dopaminergic skills: manipulating abstractions, engaging in divergent gathering and convergent reasoning, and mentally modeling what does not yet exist.

Familiarity with both art and math is becoming more important. Not only does simultaneous skill in both lead to greater opportunities, many modern pursuits now require it. Carnegie Mellon University recognized this when in 2022 they launched a new degree program for a Bachelor of

Engineering Studies and Arts. To introduce the effort, the university showcased Professor Thomas Sullivan, who is affiliated with both the School of Engineering and the School of Music. His work includes sound processing for guitars that captures the individual strings (known as “hexaphonic processing”) and the use of technology for including sound and light in art installations.84

If you’re an artistic type who thinks you can’t do numbers, give it another chance. Start with the basics of arithmetic. Pick up a book from the For Dummies series such as Everyday Math or Math for Real Life. If you already have a good grasp of arithmetic, you’ll find that introductory books on algebra, calculus, or statistics are much easier to master than you expect —being motivated to learn these things for practical reasons instead of academic ones tends to make things easier. Also consider apps such as Duolingo—recently expanded to include math training—that “gamify” learning. You’ll find that the step-by-step approach will leverage your dopaminergic reward system to sustain your interest. You’ll also sense something familiar: The circuits you’ve relied upon in one realm will now fire toward mastery in another.

If you’re a numbers- or reason-focused type mystified by the attraction of art, start with the thing you do best, logical thinking. Approach the “mystery” the way you approach any other problem, by inventorying its qualities (divergent thinking) and, from that exercise, finding ways to make sense of it intellectually (convergent thinking). Consider a painting. Don’t ask questions that just lead to navel-gazing, such as whether it’s pretty or what the artist was trying to say. Ask questions that leverage your skill for objective analysis. For instance, note how large or small the canvas is. Ask how this affects the level of detail that’s possible to put in the space given the size of the subject. How deeply did the artist exploit the possibilities of the medium? What are the elements of the image? Is there a visual center to what you see, and if so, where is it located? What colors are in use? How do they relate to colors in real life? What is the effect of light? What is the texture of the painting and how does it affect what you see?

There are lots of reasons to learn to appreciate art, but one of the best is to enrich your appreciation of everything else. Art can give you fresh ways to consider what you already know and push you toward new thinking

about the familiar. Regarding math, one of the great things about appreciating numbers and logic is that it allows you to recognize order in things that can seem chaotic. This in turn can reveal “methods to the madness” that enhance the abilities you already have. From either side, embracing the other realm will grow your productivity in everything, and draw you toward a richer, more fulfilling life.

THE MULTITASKING TRADE-OFF

We can do only one thing at a time. What we call multitasking isn’t some workaround for this limit, it’s just stopping an activity and moving to another. When you think about it that way, you understand why multitasking doesn’t help you get things done faster. In fact, it slows you down, because the more transitions you make, the more time you waste. As much as 40% of the time you spend multitasking goes not to the work you’re doing but to the act of switching between the jobs and mentally reorienting.85 All this setting and resetting of our brains introduces error, slows execution, impairs learning, and makes us more susceptible to distraction.

But that’s not the end of the story. Although multitasking won’t make our productivity faster, it can make us more original.

Cognitive fixation is a bias toward the known. It occurs when we restrict our thinking to familiar methods and ideas—when control dopamine is firmly in charge, using the linear tools of rational thought to solve a problem and confining us to consider only what is, not what might be. Artificial intelligence researcher Tony McCaffrey suggests a tragic example:86 The people on the Titanic overlooked the possibility that the iceberg could have been their lifeboat. Newspapers from the time estimated the size of the iceberg to be fifty to one hundred feet high and two hundred to four hundred feet long. Titanic was able to navigate for a while and could have pulled aside the iceberg. Many people could have climbed aboard it, McCaffrey postulates, to find flat places to stay out of the water for the four hours before help arrived. But the passengers were fixated on the fact that icebergs sink ships. Therefore they overlooked the possibilities of using the

iceberg as a temporary “boat.” They didn’t consider its size and shape, or the fact that it would not sink.*

With an understanding of cognitive fixation, let’s return to a consideration of multitasking. Switching from one task to another reduces the time we spend constructively working. But multitasking has a benefit: when we’re yanked away from familiar thinking, we seem to open ourselves to fresh approaches. In one study, researchers directed a group of participants to alternate tasks on command. Another group was allowed to switch on their own. About half of the directed group successfully solved problems that required original thinking, compared to only 12% of those who switched at their own discretion.87 Interrupting typical thinking—not just multitasking on our own but multitasking on external command— seems to push us toward unconventional problem solving. Sticking to the normal ways of thinking until we tire of them—multitasking when we’ve come to a dead end—doesn’t have nearly as powerful an effect.

If you’re working to solve a problem, try jarring yourself out of cognitive fixation. Set a timer and force yourself to switch between tasks every few minutes or, better yet, choose random intervals, or put the choice in the hands of someone else. What you lose in efficiency, you may make up in originality.

* There’s a story, likely apocryphal, that has long floated around Washington, DC, communications circles. A now-defunct website known for its catchy, clickbait headlines came up with them through calculated brainstorming. The rumor was that staff would sit in a room and write no fewer than two hundred headlines for every story. The one they published would always be one of the last ten or so they came up with—because that’s when the truly unique ideas appeared. † I’ll expand on the connection between dreams and creativity in chapter 16. * For the sake of completeness, smart aleck, I acknowledge that not everyone agrees this could have worked.

### Cultivating Creativity

Chapter 16

CULTIVATING CREATIVITY

FOR MY NEXT TRICK . . .

One of my hobbies is magic. I started performing up-close and stage magic as a teenager and never stopped. Although I often like to open my seminars and keynotes with an illusion to illustrate the topic at hand, I enjoy studying techniques and “secrets” of magic even more. There’s no other discipline like it.

When I studied math and physics, I learned a great catalog of principles and techniques, then applied those approaches over and over to various situations. But when it comes to magic, there are few principles that get used repeatedly. Nearly every trick requires a unique method; for instance, the technique behind making a coin disappear is good for only that and not much more. The same goes for making an object float in the air, mindreading, and sawing your assistant in half. The science of science calls for a consistent approach used repeatedly. The science of magic calls for a stream of one-of-a-kind ideas used for a single purpose and probably nothing else. To create a new magic trick is to engage in profoundly creative thinking, because you have to blaze your own trail, and likely think in a way that no one has before.

People who design original magic use the brain in ways that—ahem— most people aren’t creative enough to imagine. Magic demands constant invention because every trick is a new puzzle, a fresh challenge to the

ingenuity of the mind. In this way, the work of designing magic is also the dopamine system firing on all cylinders: it requires serious creativity.

HOW TO BE CREATIVE WITHOUT TRYING

Creativity is in many ways an unconscious act, but there are things we can do purposefully and consciously to increase our creativity.

You’ve heard the old saying that “life is what happens while you’re making other plans.” In the same way, creativity is what happens when you’re doing other things—and dopamine is all about bringing us into contact with other things. That’s why people who rely on their creativity for their art or their employment often carry a notebook. When an unusual thought occurs to them, they write it down. It could be a different perspective on an old idea, a combination that hadn’t occurred to them before, an unusual phrase, a provocative image, a striking turn of phrase, a word that sounds strange—and none of these arrived by looking for them. This is how creativity often works: the unconscious mind sorts through the otherwise low-salience stimuli hanging around inside us, weighing raw input and promising combinations for novelty and utility. The output might be fully formed or not. It might be something to prompt further thought later. Whatever comes out, our minds are doing divergent and convergent processing in the background, then offering up a potentially useful result as it appears.

We get far fewer original ideas from “thinking harder” than we do from letting our minds wander. Illustrator and graphic designer Christoph Niemann says, “I hate so much the idea of no control, but this approach of not planning opens a new door. It’s really hard, but it just leads to these magic moments.”125 We can invoke Dorothy Parker’s “disciplined eye” at will. It’s the wild mind that comes more often unbidden. Creative thinkers covet those moments.

Breakthroughs not just in art but also in engineering, mathematics, language, and science come when creative minds take paths that no one else has followed. Wandering from the well-worn path happens most often when we let our minds wander to other matters—ironically, when we’re not trying to be creative at all. By being aware that creativity arrives on an

uncertain schedule along unexpected roads, we can be on the lookout for useful material and capture it—in a notebook, a text, an email, or something else. Being creative is just as important as noticing when you’re being creative and not even trying.

PRACTICE!

You’ve heard the old joke: How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice, practice, practice!126 Turns out that, in one key way, creativity is a skill like playing baseball or speaking a foreign language: the more you do it, the more accomplished you get.

Creativity is built on connection. Isaac Newton connected the acceleration of an apple falling from a tree with the orbits of the planets around the sun. Charles Darwin developed the theory of evolution by connecting his observations of species variation with James Hutton’s ideas about changes occurring over geologic time scales. Making connections in the world seems, well, connected to connections within the brain. Researchers estimate the strength of these neural connections by measuring whether activation of one brain network leads to simultaneous activation of the other. Think of it like figuring out which cord on the power strip is the one connected to your computer: you jiggle it at the laptop end and see which one moves at the other end.

One way to test the strength of these neural connections is the Remote Associates Test. This protocol measures how well a person can make connections between seemingly unrelated words. Each question presents three cue words that are linked by a fourth word, which is the correct answer. Sample items include safety/cushion/point and pie/luck/belly.*

A group of neuroscientists found that people who get high scores on tests of creativity and who are successful in creative fields have strong connections among three networks within the brain.127 We’re already familiar with two of the three regions, the desire and control dopamine pathways. The third region is called the default mode network, which becomes active when we’re daydreaming. These three networks likely promote creativity this way. First, the default mode network produces daydreams. Its strong connection to the desire circuit delivers whatever

novelty dopamine is detecting, and that too may become a part of a daydream. The control pathway then evaluates the resulting ideas and selects the ones that are potentially useful. The researchers were right: strong connections make strong creativity. Repeated activation of brain circuits makes the connections stronger among them. “Cells that fire together wire together” is how psychologist Donald Hebb described it. That’s why when you practice something, it becomes easier to do, including creativity. When another group of scientists tested this idea with creative people, they saw that it was true. As professional pianists improvised jazz music, the researchers saw specific regions within the cerebral cortex lighting up. When they measured the level of connectivity among these regions, they found it was directly related to how much time a particular pianist had devoted to improvisational practice.

Creative ideas often feel like they come out of nowhere, but there really is a source. They come from regions within the brain that we can’t directly access. Still, we can make use of it. Although we can’t often summon a creative solution to a difficult problem on demand, we can make its appearance more likely. All we have to do is practice. If we strengthen the neural connections associated with creativity, there’s a good chance our efforts will pay off.

If you want to build your creative capacity, start doing some creative thing frequently: draw pictures, write stories, figure out story problems in a math book, work puzzles. Building your brain connections will build your creative ability. To return to that old joke, if you want to get ahead, you’ve got to practice, practice, practice.

REDECORATE AND REFRESH

Another way to build your creative capacity is to surround yourself with inspiration.

Customize your office, studio, or workspace. Cover your walls with things that comfort you and challenge you at the same time. I’ve done this in my office. The walls of this former one-car garage are crammed with framed pieces from floor to ceiling. In some places the frames are so close you can barely see the wall between. I have about two hundred objects

ranging from autographs and antique political buttons to full-sized movie posters. One of my most prized possessions: an original poster from the movie Midnight Cowboy complete with the X rating in the lower left-hand corner. I also have autographs from Bob Dylan, Don Knotts, Robert De Niro, and Vince Gilligan, and a photo in front of Broadway’s Belasco Theatre of me with Bryan Cranston, the actor who played Walter White on Breaking Bad, a show whose moral questions will always draw me in. Wherever my eyes fall, I get a happy memory and a little creative provocation, plus a blast of inspiration from my creative heroes. They followed their dreams. So can I. Todd Lubart, professor of psychology at the Université de Paris, said that while we all take inspiration from the world around us, “some people use better grade fuel.”128

Explore what you think doesn’t matter. Creative people aren’t picky. They take in what others pass by, even when it doesn’t appear to be relevant to their work. I advise my students, “If you want to become a better writer, learn a bit of a new language. Read an article about something new. Spend an afternoon at the museum looking at art.” Refill your stock of potential creative elements as an ongoing act of divergent thinking. Seek out what you’ve ignored. Open your mind.

Engage with art. A study done in South Korea found that when volunteers were asked to generate creative ideas for business, such as designing a computer keyboard, naming a pasta brand, or thinking of new ways of recycling, those who had viewed art prior to the exercise generated a larger number of ideas and their ideas were more original (i.e., less obvious).129 There is power in pretty things.

Get into nature. Although cities present us with creative architecture, street art, dynamic advertisements, and dissonant experiences for our senses, natural environments seem to enhance creativity even more than those things.130 Perhaps nature restores our capacity to pay attention.131

That’s important because purposeful divergent thinking is fatiguing. After a while, we run out of energy for it. Spending time in a natural environment is less demanding, yet the diversity of what’s available there is still a source of new material.

Once something captures our interest, paying attention to it no longer requires effort. This is called fascination, and it’s why children with ADHD

can spend hours focusing on a video game but become distracted after only a few minutes of homework. All kinds of natural phenomena are inherently interesting to human beings, but nature doesn’t monopolize our attention— call it a “soft” fascination because it leaves room for reflection and restoration. The “hard” fascination of something that absorbs us completely is more experiential than reflective. Nature doesn’t require our concentration. The familiar, even gentle stimulation fairly invites reflection, which is the path to new perspectives—to creativity.

Not everyone has a park nearby, and that’s okay. Try background recordings of wind, rain, or natural sounds. Even pictures of nature132 seem to help, as do plants.133

USE YOUR DREAMS

Aldous Huxley advised us to “dream in a pragmatic way,” meaning we should tailor even our biggest plans to fit the possible. But the philosophy that dopamine leads us to is less like Huxley’s and more like George Bernard Shaw’s, who said we ought to “dream things that never were”—a dopamine specialty—“and say, ‘why not.’ ”*

When you sleep, your brain operates differently than it does when you’re awake. The levels of H&N chemicals go down and dopamine goes up. This can be useful for anyone trying to be more creative. While we are not closed off from our senses during sleep, they become less important to our mental processing than dopamine, which can now make uninterrupted connections among whatever is already on your mind or hiding away in memory.

For most of us, this unimpeded dopamine experience is the closest we will come to experiencing aspects of mental illness. We know this is true because when we compare the dream stories of healthy people and the waking stories of those with severe mental illness, there is no difference. It’s not a surprise: many of the pathways of healthy creativity also activate during schizophrenic experiences. Art, especially music, is full of examples of the result of overstimulated dopamine circuits, whether brought on by mental illness, drugs, or both. While drugs are risky and mental illness is painful, some of the creative products they’ve produced are beautiful,

amazing, and moving. But you don’t have to get high or suffer mental illness to stimulate yourself toward creativity. Dreams can inspire anyone.†

Episodes of dreaming occur throughout the night, with the first episode usually beginning around ninety minutes after you first fall asleep. Dreams are often characterized by bizarre, irrational material, but dreaming isn’t the only time during sleep that our minds generate bizarre ideas. It also happens just as we’re crossing the threshold from wakefulness to sleep. This twilight of consciousness is when we sometimes get our best ideas. It’s called hypnagogia.

As we’re drifting off, our thoughts tend to become muddled. Reality twists and warps, mingling with our own imaginings. The mind travels from one idea to another more fluidly, often along irrational pathways. If you’ve been focused on a specific activity before going to bed, that may dominate the experience as you drift off. This has been called the Tetris effect because people who play the video game Tetris for extended periods often find themselves compulsively thinking about how shapes in the real world can be rotated to fit together.

If you’ve been working hard on a problem before you go to sleep, the hypnagogic state may produce divergent, solution-oriented thoughts on the matter. Usually, however, the state slips by unnoticed. The exception? When we happen to wake up in the middle of it. American inventor Thomas Edison (who acquired over a thousand patents) found this state to be so productive, he came up with a clever strategy for ensuring he would retain the ideas that were generated. He would settle himself into a comfy chair and close his eyes to go to sleep. In his hand, he would hold a heavy metal ball. Muscles relax in the hypnagogic state, so when he reached it, the ball would fall to the floor with a loud bang and wake him up. That allowed him to jot down any creative ideas that had emerged during the hypnagogic state. The surrealist painter Salvador Dalí did something similar using a heavy key. One can easily imagine the dopaminergic state of hypnagogia being of great value to a surrealist.

Scientists tested this strategy in the laboratory by giving volunteers math tests.134 All the problems could be solved through a straightforward though laborious method—but there was a sneaky, easy solution too. After working on the problems for a while, half the volunteers were instructed to

take a nap. The scientists monitored their brain activity so they could wake them during the hypnagogic state. The volunteers reported strange visions that seemed to be loosely related to the research. They described “dancing numbers and geometrical shapes, the Roman Colosseum, and a hospital room with a horse.”

Among the volunteers who took the interrupted nap, 83% found the hidden key to the math test compared to only 30% of those who stayed awake. The effect disappeared if a volunteer was allowed to enter a deeper stage of sleep. One of the researchers commented, “Our findings suggest there is a creative sweet spot during sleep onset. It is a small window which can disappear if you wake up too early or sleep too deep.”

Among the nappers who found the key, the insight didn’t happen right away. The solution tended to dawn on them after they went back and spent a considerable amount of time wrestling with the problems. It’s reminiscent of the luck of the prepared. The desire dopamine system doesn’t deliver on command, but this research suggests there are ways we can work with it to make it an ally.

When you wake from a dream, you’re conscious at the same time dopamine is the most powerful force in your brain. Your thinking is more fluid, you’re making leaps from topic to topic, and logic doesn’t matter. This can be the most creative moment of your day. The trick is catching the memory of those dreams before they fade away. To take advantage of this kind of creativity, make a plan to make use of the moments just after you wake up, a time we referred to in The Molecule of More as “this crack between two worlds.”

Focus deeply on a problem of interest just before you go to bed. The brain continues to work on problems while we’re asleep. By making a problem the last thing you think of as you drift off, you’re “assigning” the task to your unconscious mind, a powerful source of original thinking and new ideas. Have you ever had an answer just come to you out of the blue? That was a product of unconscious processing. “Sleeping on it” is a way to access this power.

Put a notebook by your bed. When you wake up, write down what’s on your mind.

Write it down right away. Don’t simply say you’ll remember it later. You won’t. In those moments that your brain isn’t fully engaged in

conscious thought, your memory isn’t either.

Don’t judge it for value. Treat it as what it is, a contribution to divergent thinking.

Don’t try to make sense of it right away. It’s probably symbolic and metaphorical. Analyze it later.

Decide to be open to the unlikely. Let dopamine do what it does best.

DON’T WAIT FOR SOMEONE TO GIVE YOU THE GO-

AHEAD

As you learn in elementary school, two plus two is four. And it’s going to be four every day, all day. You can swear it’s five and that won’t change a thing. But sadly, facts don’t matter in every situation. Comedian John Mulaney says, not entirely joking, that a lot of getting through college “is just your opinion.” In a literature class, he says, you might raise your hand and say, “‘I think Emily Dickinson’s a lesbian,’ and they’re like, ‘Partial credit!’”135

When it comes to predicting who will be creative, researchers rely a lot on “partial credit.” That’s because in a few areas of “knowledge” there aren’t that many facts to have—at least facts that are useful. Since we know more about the ingredients of creativity than its process, tests of creative potential are usually just subjective, even opinion-driven inventories of qualities. That’s a limited approach. Saying, “This person lacks certain characteristics so they’re less likely to be creative” is like saying, “This car has no gasoline engine so it’s probably not going to work.” Tesla, anyone? Thinking about creative potential as ticking the required boxes is a poor way to approach the matter.

Consider one of the most widely accepted tests of creativity, the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT). It focuses only on divergent thinking. The reasoning phase, convergent thinking, goes begging, yet the TTCT is among the most widely respected and widely used of these exams. It tests for five abilities:136

• Fluency, the creation of multiple ideas relevant to the first • Originality, the creation of original ideas that are statistically rare

• Elaboration, the development of additional related ideas • Abstractness of Titles, the creation of abstract ideas to convey the essence of a category • Resistance to Premature Closure, the processing of new ideas on a sustained basis

If you took the test, would scoring low on one or more of these discourage you from trying to be creative? After all, it’s a test created by experts. Shouldn’t they know? But wait—before you decide you’re not creative, consider this: earlier versions of the test measured only four of these abilities. You might have come out as “creative” on that version and feel great about yourself. Too bad you took the newer version. Hmm.

Perhaps you could see how you do on other tests. There are quite a lot, such as the thirty-four yes–no items of the Biographical Inventory of Creative Behaviors; the Creative Product Inventory and its categories of Generation, Reformulation, Originality, Relevancy, Hedonics,* Complexity, and Condensation; and the Creative Product Semantic Scale with its three axes of Novelty, Resolution, plus the grab-bag twofer of Elaboration and Synthesis. Oh—and be sure to bring an extra pencil, because educators and psychologists typically assess creativity with an intelligence test, too, such as the Stanford–Binet.

Make no mistake, these tests are valid investigative tools. They measure what they say they measure and do so accurately. They have their uses. The problem is attaching the word creativity. That skill is simply too big, too multidimensional, and too beyond our imagination to be dissected “by the numbers” at this point in time. The brain in many ways remains a mystery, and creativity is an especially challenging process to quantify.

The beautiful thing about creativity is that it is infinitely pliable in appearance and definition. That’s good news for those who appreciate creativity, but for anyone who wants to measure it, it’s a stopper.

Here’s the point: Start being creative right now. Don’t wait for some test (or, God forbid, some “expert”) to predict whether you’ll succeed. The ability to be creative is in every one of us. It requires only exercise and cultivation.

As a university professor, I meet lots of people who are certain that once they are equipped with a formal imprimatur, they will be able to start in on

what they really want to do. That’s true for electrical engineering but not for aspiring painters, musicians, writers, comedians, philosophers, landscape artists, and so forth. It makes me sad to meet people who need external validation before they will pursue the creative life they want. For every great singer coming out of years of classical training, there are dozens more who got good at it by doing it for fun on their own. For every novelist who spent a couple semesters at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, there are hundreds who decided they’d like to write a novel instead of just read one, opened a Word document, and started filling the pages. Training is fine but it’s not necessary. Creativity itself is already inside you.

If you want to be creative, you already believe that it’s going to be fun. That’s reason enough to get started. If you find the work isn’t for you, it’s a safe bet that a certificate won’t change how you feel. Personally, I play guitar because I like it, not because I’m good at it. Creativity is a delight no matter how good you are at the start. Aptitude doesn’t matter, only desire.

BUILDING A CREATIVE STATE OF MIND

You know the quote: Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.137 It’s the same for creative power. Creativity is the product of dopamine circuits in the brain, largely hidden and mostly inscrutable. Inspiration arrives unbidden and without warning, as if the universe has blessed you with the answer. Even when we know what’s really going on in terms of neuroscience, the feeling remains of having experienced a miracle. The good news is that we understand enough about creativity that we can make miracles more likely.

It begins with the cultivation of a state of mind favorable to the process. We must use our conscious mind to make our unconscious mind aware of what we’d like to figure into the answer we seek: our likes and dislikes, limits, sensibilities, skills, long-term goals, short-term desires, and what we’re willing to accept in the end. From that, the creative process proceeds as dopamine-driven speculation about the future using all those building blocks of the here and now. In short, our ability to creatively imagine the future depends on our ability to interact with the present. We assemble what might be out of what is and derive order out of disorder. This is how

humankind acquires what we did not have before: new, highly valuable, often life-changing insights, methods, and technologies.

You will be more creative if you emphasize the gathering phase as a separate act from the analysis phase, and if you improve and expand your catalog of other abilities. The methods and encouragements in this chapter are all things you can easily make a part of your life. Also, unlike some of the techniques for addressing other kinds of dopamine-related challenges, the things that build creativity are almost all easy and fun. The most effective thing you can do to be more creative? Practice new ways of thinking in everything you do:

Give it all you have. Louis Pasteur, who discovered the principles of vaccination, famously said, “Chance always favors the prepared mind.” Original ideas don’t appear out of nowhere. They come from a vigorous approach to life and a mind filled with facts and understanding. It’s been called “the luck of the diligent.”138 So when you need to learn something new, don’t learn it halfway. Learn it completely. And when you work at something, don’t give it half an effort. Give it all you have.

Seek out whatever is different, unusual, or out of place. Our sense of salience directs us away from anything that seems less than useful, but we can override this habit with the conscious mind. One aspect of embracing the here and now is giving purposeful consideration to the things around you, especially those things that you’ve typically ignored. Start looking for them. Break the tendency to overlook ideas that fall outside the expected domain. One reason that fortune favors the bold is it takes a bold personality, or at least a highly confident one, to entertain ideas from any source.

Look for novel uses for ordinary objects. This can strengthen the connections between diverse regions within the brain and make you more creative overall.

Occasionally work on several things at once. As we’ve seen, switching between several tasks rapidly shakes you free from cognitive fixation. Scheduled task-changing is more effective than changing on your own. The otherwise inefficient approach of multitasking can shake you out of your usual ways of thinking and open you to new habits and, hopefully, fresh, creative answers.

Switch sides. Artists gain creativity by growing their capacity with quantitative reasoning, and logic-minded people gain creativity when they apply reason to what seems subjective. There is often exquisite order within chaos, and intricate beauty within order.

Plan times to let your mind wander. When your mind is unfocused, it’s kind of like sleeping while you’re awake. In moments like that, dopamine has more power and the overwhelming here and now fades. This is when creative ideas are more likely to appear. Do something aimless, or tuck into some mindless work like clearing your inbox or sorting a drawer. The more you do this, the more your creative side can root around in the latest delivery you’ve provided from the here and now.

Creativity arises out of a rich interior life. The only one who can build your mind this way is you.

* The correct answers are “pin” and “pot.” * Shaw didn’t say this off the top of his head. It’s a line of dialogue from his 1921 stage play Back to Methuselah, a three-hundred-page journey from Biblical Creation to the year AD 31,920. The line is spoken by Satan to Eve in the Garden of Eden, and it comes on the first night of a play that takes three nights to perform. With all that in mind, perhaps we should take it as a warning, not encouragement. † Some kinds of mental illness are at times associated with great creativity, but they are not conditions to leave untreated, nor is this something to aspire to. The profound suffering that can come with mental illness makes creativity more difficult to exercise, not easier. Treatment is available. If you need help, get it. You will feel better, and you deserve to. Your art will be waiting for you on the other side and it will be better under your command. * Let me save you the trouble of looking it up: hedonics is the ethical consideration of the relationship between duty and pleasure. It’s also the branch of psychology dealing with the study of pleasant or unpleasant sensations.
